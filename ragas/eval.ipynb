      "page_content=\"Value for Money Assessment\\nIntroduction\\nThe Value for Money (hereafter “VfM”) analysis consists of carrying out an assessment of the overall cost of the project, taking into account the value of the inherent risks, depending on whether the project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP.\\nThe analysis and comparison of the financial profitability of different options is ultimately measured by means of the VfM. In order to assess the VfM of each option, we use the results of the financial model which adopts the point of view of the MITC and the private partner by estimating the overall cost of the project for the public sector of each option over the project duration.\\nThis cost is then risk-adjusted, i.e., the cost of risks borne by the public sector (and which have not been transferred to the private partner) is added. The cost of risks is provided by the risk register, the results of which are in Appendix 3 section.\\nBest practice in financial analysis and modelling requires that a set of different options and sensitivities be evaluated and compared.\\nThe Value for Money is a percentage which indicates in absolute terms the increase in value offered by the PPP option compared to the public procurement option, i.e., an option where the project is carried out with one or more traditional procurement models.\\nThe Value for Money for the PPP option is achieved through the commitment of efficiency, effectiveness and savings that can be achieved by the private sector and the appropriate allocation of risk in the project. Factors that determine whether the VfM of a PPP option is positive include:\\nA better distribution of risks which are allocated to the counterparty that is the best to manage it;\\nLong-term contract: predictability of costs and revenues for counterparties;\\nCall for tenders implemented quickly;\\nImproved quality of service;\\nCompensation structure based on performance incentives; and\\nReduction of costs over the life cycle of the project thanks to an optimization of the maintenance of the infrastructures.\\nQuantitative assessment\\nIn order to quantitatively assess the VfM, the financial model estimates the cost to the public authority for each option. The project costs, which are borne by the project company during the term of the contract, are risk-adjusted and then compared in terms of NPV to the costs of the risk-adjusted Public Sector Comparator. In the following section, we present the results of this analysis. The different total costs of the project for the Public Sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down below. We remind that the Value for Money only makes sense for PPP scenario that are bankable (Debt is paid with DSCR >1.2) and attractive to investors (Equity IRR > 15%).\\nValue for Money for the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included)\\nFor the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design 10 floors-with subsidy-VAT Included, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is PSC 1, the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\\n\\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 4 048 699    thousand) for Sc.3-DBFOT-Init. Design-with subs.-VAT Inc., this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the estimated value of the risks retained by the public authority, which is lower for the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator (where the public authority bears all the risks of the project). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the Public Sector by 11.9% for Sc. 3: DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included.\\nThe private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues cover operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, equity, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and expenses are investment costs (CAPEX) and capitalized interest.\\nThe revenues of the Public Sector in the PPP options are mainly taxes generated from the operation of the project.\\nValue for Money for the Scenario 4 (DBFOT-Revised design 4 floors-with subs.-VAT Inc.)\\nFor the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\"\n",
      "page_content='**Title: Table 43 Cost of the project for the Public Sector in the public procurement model - risk-adjusted – Sc.4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.**\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nThis table compares the Public Sector Comparator 3 (for Sc 4) with the Sc.4-DBFOT-4 floors-with subs.-VAT Inc. scenario in terms of the cost of the project for the public sector.\\n\\nThe key findings are:\\n\\n* The PV of Debt service is lower for the Sc.4-DBFOT scenario (-16,136,723) compared to the Public Sector Comparator (-24,362,596).\\n* The PV of VAT and Taxes is higher for the Sc.4-DBFOT scenario (2,681,568 and 2,356,942, respectively) compared to the Public Sector Comparator (0 for both).\\n* The PV of O&M Costs is lower for the Sc.4-DBFOT scenario (0) compared to the Public Sector Comparator (-3,290,826).\\n* The PV of Operation revenues is lower for the Sc.4-DBFOT scenario (-4,176,086) compared to the Public Sector Comparator (16,251,926).\\n* The Public Sector NPV - Risk Free is lower for the Sc.4-DBFOT scenario (-15,275,228) compared to the Public Sector Comparator (-11,401,496).\\n* The NPV of risks is lower for the Sc.4-DBFOT scenario (-1,392,429) compared to the Public Sector Comparator (-3,291,676).\\n* The NPV for the public sector - With risks is lower for the Sc.4-DBFOT scenario (-16,667,657) compared to the Public Sector Comparator (-14,693,173).\\n* The Value for Money is negative for the Sc.4-DBFOT scenario (-1,974,485) and represents -13.4% of the Public Sector NPV - Risk Free.'\n"
