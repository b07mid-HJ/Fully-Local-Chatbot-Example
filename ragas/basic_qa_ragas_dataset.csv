"Explain the legal framework for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in Malawi, highlighting the key provisions of the Public-Private Partnership Act (PPP Act) No. 23 of 2022.","The legal framework for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in Malawi is provided by the Public-Private Partnership Act (PPP Act) No. 23 of 2022. The PPP Act aims to promote the development and implementation of PPP arrangements for the efficient delivery of infrastructure and services in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and social development.

Key provisions of the PPP Act include:

1. **Establishment of the Public-Private Partnership Commission:** The PPP Act establishes the Public-Private Partnership Commission, which is responsible for regulating and overseeing PPPs in Malawi. The Commission is responsible for developing and implementing policies and guidelines for PPPs, approving PPP projects, and monitoring and evaluating the performance of PPPs.

2. **PPP Project Approval Process:** The PPP Act sets out a process for the approval of PPP projects. PPP projects must be approved by the Minister of Finance and the Public-Private Partnership Commission. The approval process involves the development of a business case, a feasibility study, and an environmental and social impact assessment.

3. **PPP Contract Structure:** The PPP Act provides for two main types of PPP contract structures:

   - **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV):** A SPV is a separate legal entity that is created to implement the PPP project. The SPV is owned by the private sector partner and the public sector partner.

   - **Joint Venture (JV):** A JV is a partnership between the private sector partner and the public sector partner. The JV is not a separate legal entity.

4. **Risk Allocation:** The PPP Act provides for the allocation of risks between the private sector partner and the public sector partner. The allocation of risks is based on the principles of value for money and risk sharing.

5. **Dispute Resolution:** The PPP Act provides for a dispute resolution mechanism for PPP projects. Disputes between the private sector partner and the public sector partner are resolved through arbitration or mediation.

The PPP Act is a comprehensive legal framework that provides a clear and transparent process for the development and implementation of PPPs in Malawi. The Act is designed to promote private sector participation in the delivery of infrastructure and services, and to ensure that PPPs are implemented in a manner that is fair and equitable to both the private sector and the public sector.","['Title: Table 49 Qualitative VfM – Achievability\n\nSummary:\n- There is evidence that the private sector is capable of delivering the required outcome.\n- Commercial interest in the project is expected to be high.\n- Market failure is evidenced due to poorly governed infrastructure and lack of communication and integration.\n- There are numerous other PPP projects in the pipeline for Malawi and the region.\n- Incentives should be put in place to ensure integration risk is minimal.\n- Sufficient time should be allocated to the procurement.\n- The size of this contract is sufficient to justify the transaction costs.\n- This deal is of strategic importance to the market and the investment opportunities in Malawi.\n- The procuring authority is being advised by leading financial, technical, and legal advisors.\n- Overall, a PPP procurement is achievable and attractive to the market.'
 'The legal, regulatory and policy framework for the project comprises the Republic of Malawi Constitution of 1994 as well as various legislations that cover public private partnerships, infrastructure development permits, real estate issues, foreign direct investments, controls on foreign exchange transactions, dividend repatriation and requirement for environmental and social impact assessments.\nThe legal framework for PPP in Malawi consists of the Public-Private Partnership Act (the “PPP Act”) No. 23 of 2022 which provides :\nfor partnerships between the public sector and private sector for the supply of infrastructure and delivery of services as means of contributing towards sustaining economic growth, social development and infrastructure development;\nfor the development and implementation of public private partnership arrangements in Malawi for the delivery of infrastructure and services; to provide for the establishment of the Public-Private Partnership Commission;\nfor privatisation of state owned enterprises, commercial entities and commercial assets; and\n to provide for matters connected with or incidental to the foregoing.\nThe PPP Act facilitate the development and implementation of public-private partnership arrangements for purposes of efficient delivery of infrastructure and services in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and social development, therefore it can be perfectly adapted to the Project. \nThe PPP Act No. 23 of 2022 enacted into law by Parliament on the 5th of April 2022 and is now operational. The overall objective of the new law is to promote expedited and efficient implementation of PPP arrangements. The PPP Law provides for the possibility to structure the Project through: \na Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) incorporated under the Companies Act specifically for this purpose or;\na Joint Venture agreement (JV) between the Contracting Authority and the private Partner, provided that the Joint Venture provisions may be incorporated into the public-private partnership agreement.\nThe shareholders of the Special Purpose Vehicle shall be the Minister responsible for Finance and the private Partner and the two must enter into a Shareholders agreement the terms of which must be as prescribed by the Minister.\nThe PPP framework in Malawi also compromises the Public-Private Partnership Policy Framework, approved by Cabinet on 18 May 2011, setting out the policy framework for initiating, designing and implementation of PPPs in Malawi.\nThe legal status of Malawi Investment and Trade Centre as a Contracting Party\nThe Malawi Investment and Trade Centre (MITC) is incorporated, under the Companies Act, as a company limited by shares since the 2 of December 2010. Directors of MITC are the Secretary of Industry and Trade, Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary for Public Sector Reforms Management. The shareholders of MITC are the Secretary of Industry and Trade and Secretary to the Treasury. MITC is a state-owned enterprise pursuant to the Companies Act No. 15 of 2013 and the Public Private Partnership Act No. 23 of 2022. Section 26 of the Companies Act provides that a company is classified as state owned if it is controlled by the Government and further, section 2 of the Public Private Partnership Act provides that a state-owned enterprise is a company in which the Government has a direct or indirect ownership and interest.  For the purposes of contracting under public-private partnership, section 2 of the PPP Act provides that a contracting authority shall include a state-owned enterprise and the state-owned enterprise shall have the power to enter into a PPP contract with private parties in accordance with 28(d) of the PPP Act. It is therefore concluded that MITC has the power to enter into a PPP Contract as a state-owned enterprise. The Directions of MITC will have the power to execute the contracts as provided for under section 74 of the Articles of Association Of MITC.\nOn a practical level, there is need for MITC to re-register the company in the current Malawi Business Registration System as directed by the Registrar of Companies so that Annual Returns and other compliance requirements are complied with.'
 'With the increased amount of lettable space there would be a number of parameters which would also increase such as increased number of car-parking spaces required, size of passenger lifts in terms of the number of stops, and associated costs.\nThe result of the above options would lead to an increase in the scope of works whilst increasing the costing and would most likely also take longer to construct. This in turn would mean MITC would be forced to occupy the building later than the current estimated time with the current size. The legal and regulatory framework governing the conduct of environmental and social impact assessment include the Environment Management Act No. 19 of 2017, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development to which Malawi is a signatory and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Malawi. An environmental and social impact assessment involves the systemic evaluation of a project to determine its impact on the physical, ecological environmental and the conservation of natural resources on the social and socio-economic fabric of a particular community and any social change process that may be associated with a project. Consequently, a project is to be planned, designed and implemented in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on the biophysical and socio-economic environment.\nSection 31 of the Environment Management Act provides that the Minister may specify the type and size of the project which shall not be implemented unless an environmental and social impact assessment is carried out. The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment contain a list of infrastructure and land development projects that are subject to assessment and offices or compound building complexes are not listed. If a project is exempt, the Director of Environmental Affairs issues a certificate and advises a developer and relevant licensing authority of the exemption and any recommendations made.\nIn the implementation of the infrastructure project between MITC and a private party, an exemption certificate will need to be obtained.\nThe Feasibility Study aims to ensure that the most appropriate legal solutions are identified at an early stage by mapping and programming the procurement timetable by reference to applicable legislation and testing the commercial principles against their deliverability in a legal and regulatory context.\nThe legal, regulatory and policy framework for the project comprises the Republic of Malawi Constitution of 1994 as well as various legislations that cover public private partnerships, infrastructure development permits, real estate issues, foreign direct investments, controls on foreign exchange transactions, dividend repatriation and requirement for environmental and social impact assessments.\nThe legal framework for PPP in Malawi mainly consists of the Public-Private Partnership Act (the “PPP Act”) adopted on 22 December 2011, as well as the Public-Private Partnership Policy Framework, approved by Cabinet on 18 May 2011. The PPP Act has been appealed by the PPP Bill that was enacted into law by Parliament on the 5th of April 2022.\nThe PPP Law provides for the possibility to structure the Project through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) or a Joint Venture agreement (JV).\nThe law in Malawi provides for permits and approvals that are to be obtained before the implementation of an infrastructure development project, namely:\nPlanning Permission;\nDevelopment Permission; and\nCompliance with Development Guidelines and Standards.\nThe Project can be structured through a public private partnership or an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contract. The legal framework in Malawi allows both structures.\nThe cycle of PPP contracts in Malawi initiated by the public authorities goes through 5 phases as shown in the following figure.'

What is the total OPEX for Year 2?,"527,511,946 MK","['Life cycle cost calculations are based on estimated cash-flows, discount rates and time horizons. Clearly these estimates cannot be known with certainty and hence risk is present. A facility exists within the model to carry out a simple sensitivity analysis to indicate those areas within the exercise, such as project time horizon, discount rate, etc., where the decision maker must ensure that data and information are both reliable and accurate.\nThe summary of the OPEX assumptions for the first year of operation (2022 prices) is presented in the following table.\nThe revenue for the Property will be generated from two sources: letting out the office space and car parking slots:\nOffice Space - The Property will have a total of 9\xa0940 square metres for the base design scenario which will be available for letting as office space.\nCar Parking – The property will have 233 car parking slots (for all the design scenarios), and these will be paid for separately by tenants in the building.\nRental charges for each of these areas are assumed based on two scenarios:\nThe first by prevailing market rates in Lilongwe City Centre as follows:\nOffice Space will be charged at MK 26\xa0250 per square metre per month.\nCar Parking Slots will be charged at MK 61 250 per parking slot per month. City assemblies are currently charging MK 33 600 per month for parking slots along street roads.\nThe second is based on a higher revenue scenario, resulting in higher rental charges as follows:\nOffice Space will be charged at MK 59\xa0278 per square metre per month.\nCar Parking Slots will be charged at MK 61 250 per parking slot per month.\nThis second scenario has been considered for the aim of increasing the profitability and the bankability of the project, which suffers from high and disproportionate development costs and debt service in comparison with the annual revenues generated from the operation of the building.

 ""As the Public Sector Comparator (PSC), the OPEX are summarised in the following table.\n\n\nMacro-Economic Forecasts\nInflation Rates, Interest Rates, Bond/Treasury Note Yields and Cash Flow Discount Factor\nReserve Bank of Malawi monetary policy is aimed at achieving price stability (low and stable inflation) in the economy by controlling growth in money supply through interest rates and reserve money. A major factor driving money supply growth hence inflation is Government deficit financing. Malawi's Inflation Rate in November 2022 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index – CPI) is 25.80%.\nIn the long-term, the Malawi Inflation Rate is projected to trend around 21.80% in 2023 and around 12.40% in 2024, according to Trading Economics.\nMalawi's annual Inflation Rates (CPI) and Government Deficit Financing have been as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistics Office Bulletins; Reserve Bank of Malawi Publications, Malawi Government Annual Economic Reports\nConsequent to the above, the following variables have been used in the financial forecasts where applicable as they currently prevail in the Economy:\nRetained annual inflation rate for the project period: 15%.\n10-Year Bond/Treasury Note Yield: 28.50% per annum. This has been as the Discount Factor to calculate present values of future cash flows. The yield has also been used as the Interest Rate on all Local Currency Long Term Debt that the Project will raise as part of its Capital Structure.\nReference Interest Rate: 17.30% per annum. This is the Interest Rate based on which commercial banks price their short-term credit facilities. Normally a risk premium of up to 11.00% is added to determine the final price based on the risk profile of the customer. The Project has assumed a risk premium of 3.50% on all its Local Currency Short Term Debts.\nExchange Rates\nThe project has assumed a reference exchange rate of 1029 MK/ $ (November 2022) for the calculation of all the costs.\nThe Malawi Kwacha has traditionally depreciated against major convertible currencies, particularly the US Dollar, due to the persistent balance of payments deficits that the country runs.\nOver the past 10 years, the Malawi Kwacha has depreciated as follows against the US Dollar.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi\nThe Project has consequently assumed an annual depreciation rate of 10.6% in the value of the Kwacha in converting all foreign currency capital and operating expenditure items; and all foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that the Project may hold or assume.\nEconomic Growth\nThe growth of the economy which signals improved and increased economic activities hence increased demand for services, including rental space for businesses, has been based on estimated Gross Domestic Product [GDP] growth rate. Malawi's GDP (currently at US$ 12.5 billion) growth rate has been extrapolated based on the average 10-year real GDP growth rate as shown in the following table.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi, Financial and Economic Reviews; Malawi Government, Annual Economic Reports\nBased on the above, Malawi's economy is projected to grow by an average 4.0% per annum during the project forecast period.\nPopulation Growth\nPopulation growth rate, the productivity of that population, the age and gender mix of the population are also key drivers of economic activity in any country. The Malawi population has grown as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistical Office, World Bank\nThe Project has assumed an average annual population growth rate of 2.80% during the forecast period.\nShortlisted and selected PPP options\nA preliminary comparison between the different PPP options allowed by the PPP legal framework in Malawi has taken place in the Needs/Options Analysis Report through a multi-criteria assessment based on several criteria which should also be aligned with the objectives of the Malawian authorities.

What is the duration of the construction period assumed in the financial model?,2 years,"['Results of the financial modelling of the different project delivery models\nThe financial modelling of a PPP project aims to test the bankability of the project, i.e., its ability to attract private financing with its two components: debt and equity. This financing resources could be completed by a possible contribution of the Public Sector in the investment cost financing through subsidies.\nAssumptions of the model\nThe following general assumptions were used in the model:\nDuration of the PPP contract: 25 years\nDuration of construction period: 2 years\nConstruction profile per year:\nAverage amortization period: 23 years.\nThe following financial structure assumptions were used in the model:\nEquity: 40% of total debt and equity\nDebt: 60% of total debt and equity\nDebt maturity: 23 years\nInterest rate (private sector): 18%\nInterest rate (public sector): 28%\nGrace period: 2 years\nReimbursement method: constant P+I (Principal + Debt).\nEquity is provided by private investors (also called shareholders) who are often promoters, operating companies as well as specialized investment funds seeking long-term profitability (e.g., pension funds). These equity capitals usually represent about 30% of private financing. In the event of early termination of the PPP contract, this equity is not recoverable. In this financial modelling, we take a percentage of 40% as input data.\nDebt is provided by commercial banks and lenders. Debt usually accounts for about 70% of private financing. In the event of early termination of the PPP contract, the principal of the debt is “reimbursed” to the banks by the Public Sector. In this financial modelling, we take a percentage of 60% as input data.\nThe investment grant may be necessary to supplement the private financing of the PPP project and achieve full financing of the investment cost. In this financial modelling, we calculate the subsidy as a percentage of the investment cost. We vary this percentage manually until we reach a sufficient level of profitability for the shareholders (the key measurement indicator is the IRR of the shareholders (equity IRR) which must be greater than 15%) while respecting a debt service coverage ratio (Average Debt Coverage Ratio or ADSCR of at least 1.2).\nThe maturity of the debt is the period after which the debt is completely repaid. This duration is 3 years less than the contract duration. This is a requirement made by the banks to have a margin of manoeuvre of 3 years in case of an event hindering the progress of the contract (delay during the construction period, force majeure event, etc.).\nThe grace period is the period during which the project company does not repay any debt annuity to the banks. It is fixed at 2 years to cover the construction period, which means that the first annuity is paid at the end of the first year of operation.\nThe chosen reimbursement method is constant P+I. The other possible modality is linear depreciation. For the P+I, P means the principal of the debt and I means the interest of the debt. Since this quantity is constant, it implies that the project company pays a lot of interest at the start (“little” principal) and little interest at the end of the contract (a “lot” of principal). The P+I method is often preferred by investors because it allows a constant annuity.\nThe other macroeconomic assumptions of the project are:\nAnnual inflation (during the project period): 15%;\nVAT Rate: 16.5%; and\nCorporate income rate: 30%.'

 'Results of the financial models and Value for Money\nThe financial modelling of a PPP project aims to test the bankability of the project, i.e. its ability to attract private financing with its two components: debt and equity. This financing resources could be completed by a possible contribution of the State in the investment cost financing through subsidies or donor grants e.g. green economy funding.\nThe following general assumptions were used in the model:\nDuration of the PPP contract: 25 years\nDuration of construction period: 2 years\nConstruction profile per year:\nAverage amortization period: 23 years\nThe following financial structure assumptions were used in the model:\nEquity: 40% of total debt and equity\nDebt: 60% of total debt and equity\nDebt maturity: 23 years\nInterest rate (private sector): 18%\nInterest rate (public sector): 28%\nGrace period: 2 years\nReimbursement method: constant P+I\nWe have considered two options: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR (Average Debt Service Coverage Ratio), if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have only considered market rents.\nWe have assumed that the private partner will not pay any royalty (or concession) fee to the public partner.\nThis combination of different options has resulted in the following 3 scenarios as requested by the MITC and PPPCU following the submission of the draft feasibility and meeting dated 16th of April 2023:\nScenario 0: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT inclusive, with a lower inflation during construction (12%), with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in a low equity IRR (1.26%) and a low ADSCR (0.67 for which there’s a debt default), which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 1: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT exclusive, with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in a low equity IRR (1.32%) and a low ADSCR (0.68 for which there’s a debt default), which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 2: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT exclusive, with Market Rents and with a revised design (8 floors): In this scenario, the project presents an equity IRR of 1.93% and an ADSCR of 0.72 (for which there’s a debt default which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 3: DBFOT with subsidy, VAT inclusive, with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 60% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 14.42% and Minimum ADSC is 1.70 which is attractive to the private sector.\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 63.7% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 17.07% and Minimum ADSC is 1.93 which is attractive to the private sector. Without a public subsidy, the Equity IRR would be at 0.93% and Minimum ADSC at 0.65, which means that the project will not attract private investors and will not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 61.4% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 17.21% and Minimum ADSC is 1.93 which is attractive to the private sector. Without a public subsidy, the Equity IRR would be at 1.59% and Minimum ADSC at 0.70, which means that the project will not attract private investors and will not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario assumes (following the recommendation of the MITC) subsidies amounting to 40% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 7.68% and Minimum ADSC is 1.16 which will not attract the private sector. In order to enhance the Equity IRR to 17%, we suggest an exoneration from the corporation tax during the entire contract period which results is an increased Equity IRR at 10.63%.\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included-No Corporate Tax: This scenario assumes subsidies amounting to 40% of the CAPEX but with no corporate tax. In this case, Equity IRR is 10.63% and Minimum ADSC is 1.16 which is better than Scenario 6 but is still on the low range for acceptable IRRs.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to four Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:'

Whilst the EPC route provides a simple contractual framework and fast procurement process, it requires the underlying infrastructure to be entirely funded during the construction period by the public sector. Moreover, the risk profile of an EPC contract is less favourable to the public sector as the main risks (such as cost overruns, delays and interfaces) are not transferred to the contractors. Furthermore, the term of an EPC contract is limited to the construction period of the asset with possible negative impacts on the whole life cost of the infrastructure.\nConversely, PPP contracts require relatively long procurement periods in order to address the inherent complexity arising from the necessity to assess and allocate project risks between the public and private sectors. Furthermore, PPP contracts allow the public sector to rely on private funders (lenders and investors) to partly fund the capital investment costs during the construction period. PPP contracts encourage contractors to adopt a whole life cost approach to the development of the infrastructure. \nEPC contracts are commonly adopted in the development of real estate projects. Under an EPC contract, an entity is contracted to design and construct a piece of infrastructure system. Payment is usually based on a fixed lump sum price basis, but incentives, such as milestone payments or target costs (e.g. gain / pain share mechanisms) can be built in into the contract. \nFor the purposes of the Project, it is important to highlight two key differences between EPC contract and a PPP contract:\nNo private funding - under an EPC contract, the public entity would need to pay the contractor at construction milestones. The public entity should therefore have access to sufficient funds to do so.\nNo post-construction maintenance responsibility - under an EPC contract, the contractor is not usually responsible for maintenance of the asset post-completion. The public contractor would need to enter into a separate maintenance contract for the infrastructure.\nUnder a PPP contract, the contractor is responsible for the design, construction, maintenance, whole life cost and funding of the infrastructure. The contractor\'s key obligation is to make the infrastructure ""available"" to the public contractor through a fixed operational term (typically 20-25 years).'

 'Recommendations\nAlthough suggesting several revised designs for the office building with less floors in the aim of reducing the investment costs, the project did not show major improvements in terms of investors’ profitability (Equity IRR) and project debt payment ability (Minimum ADSCR). With rental levels following the market rates, we conclude that a minimum public subsidy (around 60% for the different design scenarios) is necessary to guarantee the project feasibility through public-private partnership.\nBased on the specifics of the project and the results of the financial model, we recommend the implementation of the project according to the Scenario 7: DBFOT, Revised design (6 floors), with subsidy representing 40% of the CAPEX, VAT Included and with an exoneration of Corporate Tax, with a single contract signed between MITC and a private partner for a duration of 25 years.\nThis scenario results in the least budgetary impact for the public sector among the other scenarios, with a total public debt of MK 17\u202f302\u202f955 thousand at the end of the construction period, which will serve for the financing of the subsidy to the private sector entity (63.66% of the total investment cost at the end of the construction period). This scenario also presents a positive Value for Money for the public sector (25.6%) comparing to the public procurement option.\nDue to the relatively small size of the project and the features of such real-estate projects, it was recommended in the Needs and Options Analysis Report to consider the realization of the whole project through a single PPP contract (for one private contractor) with various aspects handled by sub-contractors.\nIt is recommended to move on, as soon as possible, to the procurement stage with a focus on the following steps:\nCarrying out a legal due diligence (during the preparation of the business consultation file) to optimize contractual arrangements with the private sector (operator/private operator).\nDeveloping a transaction plan based on the selected PPP model;\nStarting the preparation of the project PPP tender documents.\nUndertaking the project under a PPP model has several advantages compared to traditional public procurement, it allows to:\nReduce the overall cost (design, construction and operation) of the project; the comparison of the selected PPP option (Scenario 7) with the public procurement option shows that the PPP option is less expensive than the public procurement (Value for Money = MK 3 147 378 thousand);\nHave a single entity responsible for the design, construction and operation;\nMobilize private financing for the realization of works related to the construction of the MITC Office Building.\nMobilizing private financing through lenders requires structuring a bankable project. This is conditional on substantial support from the Public Sector in order to guarantee the mobilization of the financial resources necessary for the payment of rents.'

What is the impact of a 10% increase in CAPEX on project NPV?,"The project NPV decreases from -37,782,812 to -31,355,423.","[""The Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 974 485  thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the fact that 4 floors do not allow an economy of scale that absorbs the risks that are still borne by the public authority. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. The reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost as opposed to the Public Sector by 13.4 % for the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\nThe Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 040 216   thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). The same explanation applies as for the previous scenario but to  a lesser extent as there are two more floors (6 instead of 4). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost for the Public Sector by 5.7% for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 6 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc. and subsidies at 40%, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is also PSC 4, the different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 5 636 716 thousand) for Scenario 6, this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. This “improved” Value for Money as opposed to Scenario 3 is mainly explained by the fact that Scenario 6’s PSC generates less revenue to the Procuring Authority which increases it’s gap with the PPP scenario. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 31.2% for Sc.6. The private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues are used to pay the operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and dividends. This high Value for Money should be tempered by the fact that the Equity IRR for Scenario 6 is only 7.78% which is not sufficiently attractive for the private sector.\nScenario 7 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., subsidies at 40% and no Corporate Tax, is a variation of Scenario 6 that is meant to provide an attractive alternative to the private sector. The different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 3 147 378 thousand) for Scenario 7, this means that this PPP option is still less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. The lower Value for Money when compared to Scenario 6 is due to the absence of Corporate Tax in this scenario (and subsequent revenue to the State). Carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 17.4% for Sc.7. The Equity IRR for Scenario 7 is 10.68% which is still on the low side and may require some additional support from the State (i.e., slightly more subsidies) depending on the competition amongst the private candidates.\nWe conclude that the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax is the option that could present the highest Value for Money for the public sector with 17.4% ensuring bankability for the private sector and affordability for the State.\nThe qualitative assessment of the VfM includes the review of the efficiencies that the SPV can provide, the existence of a competitive market, the possibility of risk transfer to the developer/investor and whether such risk transfer will be achieved within the life of the project.

 'Sensitivity analysis\nA sensitivity analysis has been applied to the financial model for scenario 3 in order to assess its resilience to changes in assumptions and risk components over the Project term. Sensitivity tests were carried out by the Consultant on the main parameters taken individually in order to judge the financial robustness of the proposed financial package. For each sensitivity, these results make it possible to measure the impact of the deviation of a variable on the main model outputs, such the equity IRR, the minimum ADSCR, costs and revenues, public sector NPV and the Value for Money.\nThe sensitivity analysis allowed to obtain the following observations on the project resilience to changes:\nAn increase in the contract period to 30 years instead of 25 resulted in an improvement in the NPV of the public sector. However, the Value for Money (VfM) becomes negative at -12.5% as the private sector’s NPV is almost unchanged. The equity IRR increased by almost 1% at 15.31%. The project IRR doubles at 2.41% and the minimum ADSCR remains almost stable. \nIf the construction period increases by 1 year, this will cause an amelioration of the NPV of the public sector as the grants are paid later, the Value for Money becomes negative at 21.1% and the project and equity IRR deteriorate at respectively 0.66% and 12.76%.\nAn increase in the construction costs by 10% will deteriorate the profitability of the project at 12.45%. The Value for Money slightly enhances at 20.4%.\nWhen the public subsidy increases by 15% of the construction costs, the equity IRR and the minimum ADSCR will jump respectively to 26.79% and 2.72. As for the public sector, this will result in a negative value for money at -3.7%.\nThe increase in the inflation rate by 5 points (20%) improved the Equity IRR (15.96%) and the minimum ADSCR (1.81) for the project company, and its operation revenue NPV will more than double. This has an adverse effect on the Value for Money that decreased at 6.7%. On the contrary, a decrease in the inflation rate by 5 points (10%) will not profit the project company nor the public sector but will enhance the Value for Money at 23.9%.\nIf the project experiences an increase in the operating costs by 10% during its whole life, this will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium (equity IRR= 13.95%) but will slightly enhance the Value for Money. However, the private debt is still paid with minimum ADSCR almost not affected (1.66). On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money. We conclude that the weight of the operating costs is negligeable comparing to the impact of the investment costs on the project parameters, which are considered very important and hard to cover through the operating revenues generated by the project.\nFinally, a further increase in the rental fees by 10% will improve the project and the equity IRRs (2.09% and 16.81% respectively) and will result in a decrease in the VfM for the public sector (circa 11.8%). This should be carefully considered as higher rental fees could induce an escape rate from the users. However, a decrease by 10% in the rental fees will result in lower equity IRR and minimum ADSCR (11.97% and 1.51 respectively). The VfM is positively affected in this scenario, which confirms that high-rental fees should be maintained to ensure the project feasibility through PPP. The private partner should make a high marketing effort to maintain the forecasted occupancy rate at its highest level. He should also ensure high standards for the building to attract tenants and keep them in the long term, and this should be embedded in the evaluation criteria.'

This scenario also presents a positive Value for Money for the public sector (17.4%) comparing to the public procurement option.\nDue to the relatively small size of the project and the features of such real-estate projects, it was recommended in the Needs and Options Analysis Report to consider the realization of the whole project through a single PPP contract (for one private contractor) with various aspects handled by sub-contractors.\nIt is recommended to move on, as soon as possible, to the procurement stage with a focus on the following steps:'

 'Selected scenarios\nSeveral cases of calculation could be envisaged in order to verify the criteria for evaluating the financial profitability of the project by varying the rents/revenue and/or the level of subsidy paid by the Public Sector to the private partner.\nIt should be noted that the definition of the subsidy rate on a new infrastructure implemented through PPP should result from a financial calculation with a view to ensuring that the operating revenues make it possible to generate sufficient cash flow to recover investment costs, repay debts, cover operating, maintenance and necessary renewals expenses, and appropriately remunerate the capital employed.\nWe have considered two scenarios: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR, if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have also considered only one scenario based on market rentals.\nAs for the annual royalty fee (or concession fee or lease fee) paid by the private partner to the MITC as a percentage of the total revenue, we have assumed that it is equal to Zero.\nThis combination of different possibilities resulted in 6 possible scenarios for the PPP option, namely:\nScenario 0: DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation;\nScenario 1: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) without subsidy-VAT Excluded;\nScenario 2: DBFOT-Revised Design (8 floors) without subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 3: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included; and\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included-No corporate tax.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to two Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:\nPSC 1: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Initial Design (10 floors);\nPSC 2: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (8 floors).\nPSC 3: Public Sector Comparator 3 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (4 floors); and\nPSC 4: Public Sector Comparator 4 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (6 floors).\n\nSc. 0-DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation\nFor this scenario, there is no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost and the rental fees for the offices (per SQM).\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37 047 288 thousand (2022 terms).

 ""Value for Money Assessment\nIntroduction\nThe Value for Money (hereafter “VfM”) analysis consists of carrying out an assessment of the overall cost of the project, taking into account the value of the inherent risks, depending on whether the project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP.\nThe analysis and comparison of the financial profitability of different options is ultimately measured by means of the VfM. In order to assess the VfM of each option, we use the results of the financial model which adopts the point of view of the MITC and the private partner by estimating the overall cost of the project for the public sector of each option over the project duration.\nThis cost is then risk-adjusted, i.e., the cost of risks borne by the public sector (and which have not been transferred to the private partner) is added. The cost of risks is provided by the risk register, the results of which are in Appendix 3 section.\nBest practice in financial analysis and modelling requires that a set of different options and sensitivities be evaluated and compared.\nThe Value for Money is a percentage which indicates in absolute terms the increase in value offered by the PPP option compared to the public procurement option, i.e., an option where the project is carried out with one or more traditional procurement models.\nThe Value for Money for the PPP option is achieved through the commitment of efficiency, effectiveness and savings that can be achieved by the private sector and the appropriate allocation of risk in the project. Factors that determine whether the VfM of a PPP option is positive include:\nA better distribution of risks which are allocated to the counterparty that is the best to manage it;\nLong-term contract: predictability of costs and revenues for counterparties;\nCall for tenders implemented quickly;\nImproved quality of service;\nCompensation structure based on performance incentives; and\nReduction of costs over the life cycle of the project thanks to an optimization of the maintenance of the infrastructures.\nQuantitative assessment\nIn order to quantitatively assess the VfM, the financial model estimates the cost to the public authority for each option. The project costs, which are borne by the project company during the term of the contract, are risk-adjusted and then compared in terms of NPV to the costs of the risk-adjusted Public Sector Comparator. In the following section, we present the results of this analysis. The different total costs of the project for the Public Sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down below. We remind that the Value for Money only makes sense for PPP scenario that are bankable (Debt is paid with DSCR >1.2) and attractive to investors (Equity IRR > 15%).\nValue for Money for the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included)\nFor the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design 10 floors-with subsidy-VAT Included, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is PSC 1, the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\n\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 4 048 699    thousand) for Sc.3-DBFOT-Init. Design-with subs.-VAT Inc., this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the estimated value of the risks retained by the public authority, which is lower for the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator (where the public authority bears all the risks of the project). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the Public Sector by 11.9% for Sc. 3: DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included.\nThe private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues cover operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, equity, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and expenses are investment costs (CAPEX) and capitalized interest.\nThe revenues of the Public Sector in the PPP options are mainly taxes generated from the operation of the project.\nValue for Money for the Scenario 4 (DBFOT-Revised design 4 floors-with subs.-VAT Inc.)\nFor the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:""
 ""The Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 974 485  thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the fact that 4 floors do not allow an economy of scale that absorbs the risks that are still borne by the public authority. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. The reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost as opposed to the Public Sector by 13.4 % for the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\nThe Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 040 216   thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). The same explanation applies as for the previous scenario but to  a lesser extent as there are two more floors (6 instead of 4). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost for the Public Sector by 5.7% for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 6 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc. and subsidies at 40%, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is also PSC 4, the different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 5 636 716 thousand) for Scenario 6, this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. This “improved” Value for Money as opposed to Scenario 3 is mainly explained by the fact that Scenario 6’s PSC generates less revenue to the Procuring Authority which increases it’s gap with the PPP scenario. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 31.2% for Sc.6. The private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues are used to pay the operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and dividends. This high Value for Money should be tempered by the fact that the Equity IRR for Scenario 6 is only 7.78% which is not sufficiently attractive for the private sector.\nScenario 7 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., subsidies at 40% and no Corporate Tax, is a variation of Scenario 6 that is meant to provide an attractive alternative to the private sector. The different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 3 147 378 thousand) for Scenario 7, this means that this PPP option is still less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. The lower Value for Money when compared to Scenario 6 is due to the absence of Corporate Tax in this scenario (and subsequent revenue to the State). Carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 17.4% for Sc.7. The Equity IRR for Scenario 7 is 10.68% which is still on the low side and may require some additional support from the State (i.e., slightly more subsidies) depending on the competition amongst the private candidates.\nWe conclude that the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax is the option that could present the highest Value for Money for the public sector with 17.4% ensuring bankability for the private sector and affordability for the State.\nThe qualitative assessment of the VfM includes the review of the efficiencies that the SPV can provide, the existence of a competitive market, the possibility of risk transfer to the developer/investor and whether such risk transfer will be achieved within the life of the project. The qualitative VfM analysis answered a series of questions about the proposed project in relation to Viability, Desirability and Achievability.""

 ""The Value for Money is negative (MK -1 974 485 thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the fact that 4 floors do not allow an economy of scale that absorbs the risks that are still borne by the public authority. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. The reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost as opposed to the Public Sector by 13.4 % for the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\n\n\nValue for Money for the Scenario 5\nAs for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\n\nThe Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 040 216 thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). The same explanation applies as for the previous scenario but to  a lesser extent as there are two more floors (6 instead of 4). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost for the Public Sector by 5.7% for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nValue for Money for the Scenario 6\nAs for the Scenario 6-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 5 636 716 thousand) for Scenario 6, this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. This “improved” Value for Money as opposed to Scenario 3 is mainly explained by the fact that Scenario 6’s PSC generates less revenue to the Procuring Authority which increases it’s gap with the PPP scenario. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 31.2% for Sc.6. The private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues are used to pay the operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and dividends. This high Value for Money should be tempered by the fact that the Equity IRR for Scenario 6 is only 7.78% which is not sufficiently attractive for the private sector.\nValue for Money for the Scenario 7\nAs for the Scenario 7-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Inc.-No corporate tax, the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 3 147 378 thousand) for Scenario 7, this means that this PPP option is still less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. The lower Value for Money when compared to Scenario 6 is due to the absence of Corporate Tax in this scenario (and subsequent revenue to the State). Carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 17.4% for Sc.7. The Equity IRR for Scenario 7 is 10.68% which is still on the low side and may require some additional support from the State (i.e., slightly more subsidies) depending on the competition amongst the private candidates.\nWe conclude that the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax is the option that could present the highest Value for Money for the public sector with 17.4% ensuring bankability for the private sector and affordability for the State.\n\nQualitative assessment\nThis section addresses the qualitative aspects of a PPP, which includes review of the efficiencies that the SPV can provide, the existence of a competitive market, the possibility of risk transfer to the developer/investor and whether such risk transfer will be achieved within the life of the project.\nThe qualitative VfM analysis seeks to answer a series of questions about the proposed project in relation to the following categories:\nViability;\nDesirability; and\nAchievability.\nViability\nFor PPP projects to be viable the investment objectives and desired outcomes of the sponsor need to be translatable into outputs that can form the basis of a contract and a sound payment mechanism. Therefore, the quality and quantity of the outputs needs to be easily measurable. Many service areas can be described in contractual terms, but some areas will be inherently ‘non contractible’ as outputs. Successful PPP transactions are those that are clearly able to measure and report on service quality in relation to key performance indicators and output-based specification.""
 'The cycle of PPP contracts in Malawi initiated by the public authorities goes through 5 phases:\n\n\nSource: Author\nIn the first phase, the PPP committee or the contracting public authority, with the support of the PPP committee, identifies the project to be implemented as a PPP, either by itself or jointly with another person or contracting authority. To this end, a Needs and Options Analysis is carried out in order to determine whether the PPP is the best solution for providing the envisaged service or infrastructure to be set up through the project in relation to other public procurement processes.\nThe conduct of this analysis is followed by the completion of a pre-feasibility study and an initial viability analysis of the Project. The pre-feasibility study indicates the possible location(s), route(s) and general cost estimates of the project and an initial indication of the likelihood of the project being viable and affordable. \nIn coordination with the Review and Authorisation Unit of the Ministry of Finance, the PPP Commission determines the requirements for the pre-feasibility study and decides whether a full feasibility study should be carried out for the project.\nIn the second phase, the contracting authority carries out a technical, financial and legal feasibility study, either through the PPP Commission or by itself when authorised by the Commission. The purpose of this study is to enable the government to assess whether the project to be carried out is sound and whether it meets the criteria of viability, risk, bankability, accessibility and appropriateness set by the government. The feasibility study should show that delivering the project as a PPP offers competitive advantages, that the PPP is the most appropriate instrument for delivering the project, that it is affordable for the contracting authority, that it offers good value for money, and that it transfers technical, financial or operational risks to the private contractor. It should also demonstrate the capacity of the contracting authority to implement the contract effectively and specify the role and functions to be performed by the public authority in setting up and implementing the agreement.\nThe next phase for project implementation is the procurement phase to select the private partner best suited to implement and execute the project. The Commission considers carrying out a pre-qualification exercise to select potential bidders or may delegate the carrying out of the pre-qualification to the contracting authority when it considers that the contracting authority has the necessary expertise to undertake this step.\nThe invitation to tenderers to submit tenders is made through the tender document which is prepared by the Commission, and which includes a public invitation to pre-qualified tenderers to submit tenders.\nIn evaluating the bids submitted, the PPP committee ensures that all bidders have equal opportunities and that their bids are treated fairly. To this end, the tender must clearly state the evaluation criteria that will be used as a basis for the evaluation of the bids. \nAfter the selection phase, the fourth phase involves drawing up the final PPP contract and signing it with the selected bidder. The public-private partnership contract may only be concluded on the basis of a decision of the PPP Committee, after obtaining the consent of the Minister of Finance and his agreement on the final version of the contract to be signed. Within thirty days from the date of receipt of the final draft contract, the PPP Committee must decide on the granting of consent for the text of the draft contract.\nIn the last and fifth phase, the implementation and evaluation of the contract, the contracting authority, supported by the PPP commission, carries out an evaluation of the entire PPP project, from project identification to implementation, in order to assess the timeliness and effectiveness of the project.'

 'Desirability\nPPP projects can provide more efficient risk management and produce incentives to develop innovative approaches to output delivery. Consistent high-quality services can be incentivized through performance and payment mechanisms. However, risk transfer is priced into the contract.\nAchievability\nWhile PPP projects may allow a more efficient and effective combination of public and private sector skills, determining the rules that will govern the relationship between the two sectors does involve significant transaction costs. In particular the procurement process can be complex and significant resources including senior management time may be required for project development and the ongoing monitoring of service delivery. PPP projects need a robust competitive process to fully deliver its benefits and so the choice of procurement route should be informed by an assessment of the likely market appetite.\n\nSensitivity analysis\nA sensitivity analysis has been applied to the financial model in order to assess its resilience to changes in assumptions and risk components over the Project term. Sensitivity tests were carried out by the Consultant on the main parameters taken individually in order to judge the financial robustness of the proposed financial package. For each sensitivity, these results make it possible to measure the impact of the deviation of a variable on the main model outputs, such the equity IRR, the minimum ADSCR, costs and revenues, public sector NPV and the Value for Money.\nThe Consultant performed the following sensitivity analyses on the key variables of the project:\nIncrease in the project term by 5 years;\nDecrease in project term by 5 years;\nIncrease in construction period by 1 year;\nIncrease in construction costs by 10%;\nDecrease in construction costs by 10%;\nA state subsidy of 15% is considered;\nIncrease in Inflation rate by 5 points;\nDecrease in Inflation rate by 5 points;\nIncrease in operating costs by 10%;\nDecrease in operating costs by 10%;\nIncrease in rental fees by 10%;\nDecrease in rental fees by 10%.\nThe following table summarizes the main outcomes of the sensitivity analysis.'

What is the minimum public subsidy required to guarantee the project's feasibility through a public-private partnership?,The minimum public subsidy required to guarantee the project's feasibility through a public-private partnership is 60% of the different design scenarios.,"['Title: Table 7 Cost of the project for the State in the public procurement model - risk-adjusted- Sc. 3: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors)-with subsidy-VAT Included\n\nSummary:\n- The table compares the Net Present Value (NPV) and Value for Money (VfM) of the public sector comparator and Scenario 3 (Sc.3) - DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included.\n- The NPV for the public sector with risks is lower in Sc.3 compared to the public sector comparator, indicating a potential cost saving for the state.\n- The VfM for Sc.3 is positive, indicating that the project is considered economically viable.\n- The VfM percentage for Sc.3 is 11.9%, which is a significant improvement compared to the public sector comparator.\n- The main differences in the NPV components between the public sector comparator and Sc.3 are:\n  - Sc.3 has a higher PV of VAT and taxes due to the inclusion of VAT and taxes in the project costs.\n  - Sc.3 has a lower PV of O&M costs as the private sector is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the project.\n  - Sc.3 has a lower PV of operation revenues as the private sector is entitled to a share of the operation revenues.'
 'Recommendations\nAlthough suggesting several revised designs for the office building with less floors in the aim of reducing the investment costs, the project did not show major improvements in terms of investors’ profitability (Equity IRR) and project debt payment ability (Minimum ADSCR). With rental levels following the market rates, we conclude that a minimum public subsidy (around 60% for the different design scenarios) is necessary to guarantee the project feasibility through public-private partnership.\nBased on the specifics of the project and the results of the financial model, we recommend the implementation of the project according to the Scenario 7: DBFOT, Revised design (6 floors), with subsidy representing 40% of the CAPEX, VAT Included and with an exoneration of Corporate Tax, with a single contract signed between MITC and a private partner for a duration of 25 years.\nThis scenario results in the least budgetary impact for the public sector among the other scenarios, with a total public debt of MK 17\u202f302\u202f955 thousand at the end of the construction period, which will serve for the financing of the subsidy to the private sector entity (63.66% of the total investment cost at the end of the construction period). This scenario also presents a positive Value for Money for the public sector (25.6%) comparing to the public procurement option.\nDue to the relatively small size of the project and the features of such real-estate projects, it was recommended in the Needs and Options Analysis Report to consider the realization of the whole project through a single PPP contract (for one private contractor) with various aspects handled by sub-contractors.\nIt is recommended to move on, as soon as possible, to the procurement stage with a focus on the following steps:\nCarrying out a legal due diligence (during the preparation of the business consultation file) to optimize contractual arrangements with the private sector (operator/private operator).\nDeveloping a transaction plan based on the selected PPP model;\nStarting the preparation of the project PPP tender documents.\nUndertaking the project under a PPP model has several advantages compared to traditional public procurement, it allows to:\nReduce the overall cost (design, construction and operation) of the project; the comparison of the selected PPP option (Scenario 7) with the public procurement option shows that the PPP option is less expensive than the public procurement (Value for Money = MK 3 147 378 thousand);\nHave a single entity responsible for the design, construction and operation;\nMobilize private financing for the realization of works related to the construction of the MITC Office Building.\nMobilizing private financing through lenders requires structuring a bankable project. This is conditional on substantial support from the Public Sector in order to guarantee the mobilization of the financial resources necessary for the payment of rents.'
 'The sensitivity analysis allowed to obtain the following observations on the project resilience to changes:\nAn increase in the contract period to 30 years instead of 25 resulted in an improvement in the NPV of the public sector. However, the Value for Money (VfM) becomes negative at -12.5% as the private sector’s NPV is almost unchanged. The equity IRR increase by almost 1% at 15.31%. The project IRR doubles at 2.41% and the minimum ADSCR remains almost stable. \nIf the construction period increases by 1 year, this will cause an amelioration of the NPV of the public sector as the grants are paid later, the Value for Money becomes negative at 21.1% and the project and equity IRR deteriorate at respectively 0.66% and 12.76%.\nAn increase in the construction costs by 10% will deteriorate the profitability of the project at 12.45%. The Value for Money slightly enhances at 20.4%.\nWhen the public subsidy increases by 15% of the construction costs, the equity IRR and the minimum ADSCR will jump respectively to 26.79% and 2.72. As for the public sector, this will result in a negative value for money at -3.7%.\nThe increase in the inflation rate by 5 points (20%) improved the Equity IRR (15.96%) and the minimum ADSCR (1.81) for the project company, and its operation revenue NPV will more than double. This is has an adverse effect on the Value for Money that decreased at 6.7%. On the contrary, a decrease in the inflation rate by 5 points (10%) will not profit the project company nor the public sector but will enhance the Value for Money at 23.9%.\nIf the project experiences an increase in the operating costs by 10% during its whole life, this will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium (equity IRR= 13.95%) but will slightly enhance the Value for Money. However, the private debt is still paid with minimum ADSCR almost not affected (1.66). On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money. We conclude that the weight of the operating costs is negligeable comparing to the impact of the investment costs on the project parameters, which are considered very important and hard to cover through the operating revenues generated by the project.\nFinally, a further increase in the rental fees by 10% will improve the project and the equity IRRs (2.09% and 16.81% respectively) and will result in a decrease in the VfM for the public sector (circa 11.8%). This should be carefully considered as higher rental fees could induce an escape rate from the users. However, a decrease by 10% in the rental fees will result in lower equity IRR and minimum ADSCR (11.97% and 1.51 respectively). The VfM is positively affected in this scenario, which confirms that a high-rental fees should be maintained to ensure the project feasibility through PPP. The private partner should make a high marketing effort to maintain the forecasted occupancy rate at its highest level. He should also ensure hight standards for the building to attract tenants and keep them in the long term, and this should be embedded in the evaluation criteria.\nConclusion and recommendations\nAlthough suggesting several revised designs for the office building with less floors in the aim of reducing the investment costs, the project did not show major improvements in terms of investors’ profitability (Equity IRR) and project debt payment ability (Minimum ADSCR).

The Feasibility Study should enable the PPPC to determine the project parameters such as project cycle costs, affordability, service levels, risks and their costs and investment results.\nThe feasibility study is inclusive of:\nAn international benchmark study for similar office building PPP projects;\nA Technical, Environmental, Legal and Regulatory assessment of the project;\nA comprehensive assessment of all the risks encountered by the project during its lifecycle;\nA Financial assessment and Modelling of the project reflecting optimal design parameters;\nA Value for Money (VFM) and Affordability analysis; and\nPayment mechanisms and MITC potential share of profit.\nThe Feasibility will demonstrate affordability for the full project life cycle and propose the optimal solution for the MITC to achieve its desired outcomes, by considering the constraints and concerns of all the key stakeholders involved.\n\nBenchmark study for similar office building PPP projects\nThe main objective of the benchmark study is to identify performance gaps and opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the construction of the office complex for Malawi Investment and Trade Center by prospecting similar projects, and to understand the business models used for their economic developments.\nIn this section, we will present an international benchmark study of relevant similar PPP projects for office buildings, namely:\nICT Parks’ project in Egypt;\nKuwait Post Office Project; and\nThe Balard Hexagon project in France.\nThis benchmark study is based on documentary research as well as the consultant's experience in advising clients on different modes of PPP procurement for similar projects around the world.""]",['The project requires a minimum public subsidy of around 60% to ensure its viability through a public-private partnership.']
What is the total cost of the project at the end of the construction period for Scenario 2?,"43,431,912 thousand","['The revenues of the public sector come from taxes collected (VAT, income tax, etc.), from which is deducted the amount of rental paid by the MITC to the private partner for its allocated space.\nThis scenario presents a low equity IRR (1.18%) and a low ADSCR (0.68), which means that implementing the project through this format does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service. For these reasons, this scenario has been eliminated from the financial modelling of the Value for Money.\n\nScenario 2: DBFOT-Revised Design (8 floors)-without subsidy-VAT Included\nFor this scenario, there is no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost. However, a revised design with 8 floors is considered.\nThe construction cost is MK 27,820,480 thousand (2022 terms). By applying inflation during the construction period, we obtain the amount of MK 39,552,029 thousand.\nFunding the cost of construction is done partly by private debt which generates capitalised interests of MK 3,879,883 thousand. The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 43,431,912 thousand.\nThis amount is financed by debt up to MK 27,611,100 thousand, equity up to MK 15,820,811 thousand and with no public subsidy.\n \nThe revenue curve corresponds to the revenue generated by the project, i.e., rental income from office space and car slots. In this case, the private partner is remunerated directly by the tenants.\n\nThe revenues of the public sector come from collected taxes (VAT, income tax, etc.), from which is deducted the amount of rental paid by the MITC to the private partner for its allocated space.\nThis scenario presents a low equity IRR (1.81%) and a low ADSCR (0.72), which means that implementing the project through this format does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service. For these reasons, this scenario has been eliminated from the financial modelling of the Value for Money.\n\n\nScenario 3: DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included \nIf the procurement authority decides to remain in compliance with market rents levels, then a public subsidy equivalent to 60% from the investment costs should be considered to ensure that the project is feasible through PPP.\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37 047 288 thousand (2022 terms). By applying inflation during the construction period (15% per year), we obtain the amount of MK 52 669\xa0666 thousand.\nThe financing of the cost of construction is done partly by private debt which generates capitalised interests of MK 2 066 667 thousand. The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 54 736 333 thousand.\nThis amount is financed by debt up to MK 14 707 386 thousand, equity up to MK 8 427 147 thousand and public subsidy up to MK 31 601 800 thousand.\n \nThe revenue curve corresponds to the revenue generated by the project, i.e., rental income from office space and car slots. The private partner is remunerated directly by the tenants.\n\nThe financing of the subsidy is entirely ensured through a public loan which generates capitalised interests of MK 6,209,423 thousand. The total cost of the project for the public sector at the end of the construction period stands at MK 37,811,223 thousand.\n\nThe revenues of the public sector come from taxes collected (VAT, income tax, etc.), from which is deducted the amount of rental paid by the MITC to the private partner for its allocated space.\nThe Scenario 3- DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included generates a high ADSCR for the private partner equivalent to 1.7. It also generates an acceptable equity IRR of 14.56% for the investors.\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included\nTo achieve the targeted Equity IRR (17%), a subsidy of 66.24% from the investment costs should be considered to ensure that the project is feasible through PPP.\nThe construction cost is MK 15 156 985 thousand (2022 terms). By applying inflation during the construction period (15% per year), we obtain the amount of MK 20 947 143 thousand.\nThe financing of the cost of construction is done partly by private debt which generates capitalised interests of MK 846 865 thousand. The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 21 794 008 thousand.\nThis amount is financed by debt up to MK 5 089 986 thousand, equity up to MK 2 829 748 thousand and public subsidy up to MK 13 875 274 thousand.\n \nThe revenue curve corresponds to the revenue generated by the project, i.e., rental income from office space and car slots.

The lettable space according to the different design scenarios is as follows:\nFor the base design with 10 floors: 9\xa0368 square metres\nFor the revised design with 8 floors: 7 348 square metres\nFor the revised design with 6 floors: 4 932 square metres\nFor the revised design with 4 floors: 3 321 square metres.\nCar Parking - The property will have 233\t car parking slots (for both the initial and revised design options), and these will be paid for separately by tenants in the building.\nRevenues/Rental Income\nThe revenue from the Property will be generated from two sources: letting out the office space and car parking slots. Rental charges for each of these areas has been assumed based the prevailing market rates in Lilongwe City Centre as follows:\nOffice Space will be charged at MK 26\xa0250 per square metre per month.\nCar Parking Slots will be charged at MK 61 250 per parking slot per month. City assemblies are currently charging MK 33 600 per month for parking slots along street roads.\nOccupancy Rate\nHigh end office buildings at City Centre in Lilongwe are currently commanding occupancy rates of between 80% and 95% based on information gathered from Knight Frank and Mpico, two of the largest property developers and managers in Lilongwe.\nAlthough an additional 50 000 square metres of office space is expected to enter the market in Lilongwe in the next 3 to 5 years, demand is expected to remain robust. Increase in demand for office space is expected to be driven by economic growth and the move by Lilongwe City Assembly to relocate all businesses from residential areas to designated business centres.\nThe Project Property has consequently assumed the following assumptions for office space and carparking area occupancy rates during the first three years and thereafter.\n\nAnnual revenues\nThe annual revenue for is presented in the following table.'

For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR, if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have also considered only one scenario based on market rentals.\nAs for the annual royalty fee (or concession fee or lease fee) paid by the private partner to the MITC as a percentage of the total revenue, we have assumed that it is equal to Zero.\nThis combination of different possibilities resulted in 6 possible scenarios for the PPP option, namely:\nScenario 0: DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation;\nScenario 1: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) without subsidy-VAT Excluded;\nScenario 2: DBFOT-Revised Design (8 floors) without subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 3: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included; and\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included-No corporate tax.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to two Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:\nPSC 1: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Initial Design (10 floors);\nPSC 2: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (8 floors).\nPSC 3: Public Sector Comparator 3 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (4 floors); and\nPSC 4: Public Sector Comparator 4 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (6 floors).\n\nSc. 0-DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation\nFor this scenario, there is no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost and the rental fees for the offices (per SQM).\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37 047 288 thousand (2022 terms).

 ""The Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 974 485  thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the fact that 4 floors do not allow an economy of scale that absorbs the risks that are still borne by the public authority. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. The reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC.

The lower Value for Money when compared to Scenario 6 is due to the absence of Corporate Tax in this scenario (and subsequent revenue to the State). Carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 17.4% for Sc.7. The Equity IRR for Scenario 7 is 10.68% which is still on the low side and may require some additional support from the State (i.e., slightly more subsidies) depending on the competition amongst the private candidates.\nWe conclude that the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax is the option that could present the highest Value for Money for the public sector with 17.4% ensuring bankability for the private sector and affordability for the State.\nThe qualitative assessment of the VfM includes the review of the efficiencies that the SPV can provide, the existence of a competitive market, the possibility of risk transfer to the developer/investor and whether such risk transfer will be achieved within the life of the project.

 ""Executive summary\nContext of the project and the presentation of the report\nThe objective of the current project is to construct an Office Complex to accommodate the Malawi Investment and Trade Center (MITC) as well as lettable spaces for offices and retail. This building will enable the MITC to enhance its quality of service as a One-Stop Service Centre for business and start-ups. In line with contemporary sustainability agenda, the Building has a “Green” theme concept design at incorporating green friendly technologies and attaining a globally recognized “Green Building” Standard Certification at Advanced stage with 40% or more on site energy savings.\nAs a transaction advisor, Unshackle Africa JV (the Consultant) has been selected by the Malawi Investment and Trade Center (MITC) and the Public-Private Partnership Commission (PPPC) to assist in the development and implementation of the assignment through:\nAssessing the technical, legal, financial and environmental feasibility of development and implementing the Office Complex under a PPP framework; and\nSupporting MITC in identifying the private partner to design, finance, construct, operate and transfer the infrastructure.\nThe previous deliverables provided by the Consultant consisted of an Inception Report, a Needs and Options Analysis Report and a Scheme/Concept Design Report.\nThe aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive Feasibility Study, which investigates the preferred identified implementation options and finalizes transaction structure. The Feasibility Study should enable the PPPC to determine the project parameters such as project cycle costs, affordability, service levels, risks and their costs and investment results.\nThe feasibility study is inclusive of:\nAn international benchmark study for similar office building PPP projects;\nA Technical, Environmental, Legal and Regulatory assessment of the project;\nA comprehensive assessment of all the risks encountered by the project during its lifecycle;\nA Financial assessment and Modelling of the project reflecting optimal design parameters;\nA Value for Money (VFM) and Affordability analysis; and\nPayment mechanisms and MITC potential share of profit.\nThe Feasibility will demonstrate affordability for the full project life cycle and propose the optimal solution for the MITC to achieve its desired outcomes, by considering the constraints and concerns of all the key stakeholders involved.\nBased on documentary research as well as the Consultant's experience in advising clients on different modes of PPP procurement for similar projects around the world, we have conducted an international benchmark study of similar PPP projects for office buildings, namely:\nICT Parks’ project in Egypt;\nA Post Office Project in Kuwait; and\nThe Balard Hexagon project in France.\nThe benchmark study has shown that in most real estate and office buildings projects, the PPP models used are the DBFOM (Design, Build, Finance, Operate, Maintain), BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) and ROT (Refurbish, Operate, Transfer) models. The revenue stream in most cases comes from user payments (leasing fees, commercial activities, etc.) with a support from the government in the form of grants if needed.\nThese selected projects have faced several difficulties such as delays, performance gaps and in extreme cases project cancellation. To avoid such issues, a number of recommendations should be taken into consideration for the MITC Office Complex Project, namely:\nMinimizing future deviations from financial, economic, and social projections with respect to project outcomes at the initial preparation stages;\nEnsuring that users projections are accurate as much as possible; and\nWhen sufficient financial resources are available, structuring the project around availability payments.\nOne of the options that could be explored is to restrict the development to the plot which has been leased to MITC which would mean that the car-parking designed for land outside the leased plot would be left out. To compensate for the 105 car-parking spaces that would be lost, the option would be to create at least two additional basement floor parking.\nWith the reported existence of an underground river on the site, the additional car-parking basement floors would require waterproofing treatment as well as enhanced ventilation apart from the provision of passenger lifts that cover the two additional floor stops. The cost implications of providing the additional basement car parking floors is considered to be higher than providing the same number of car-parking spaces over ground.\nAnother option that could have been explored is to adhere to the size of building that MITC requested in the Needs and Options Report which was 12 500 m2 instead of the 9 940 m2 of lettable space that was actually provided. This leads to a deficit of 2 560 m2 equivalent to just over three (3) additional floors and this would in turn make the building a sixteen (16) floor development.""

"Explain why the Value for Money is negative for Scenario 4 and Scenario 5, and how the number of floors affects this outcome.","The Value for Money is negative for Scenario 4 (DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.) and Scenario 5 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.) because these PPP options are more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator).

The number of floors affects the Value for Money because it affects the economy of scale. A larger number of floors allows for a greater economy of scale, which reduces the risks that are still borne by the public authority. This, in turn, reduces the cost of the project for the public sector.

In Scenario 4, the reduction in the number of floors from 10 to 4 reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios, but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. This means that the reduction in the number of floors does not fully offset the increased cost of the PPP option.

The private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues are used to pay the operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and dividends. This high Value for Money should be tempered by the fact that the Equity IRR for Scenario 6 is only 7.78% which is not sufficiently attractive for the private sector.\nScenario 7 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., subsidies at 40% and no Corporate Tax, is a variation of Scenario 6 that is meant to provide an attractive alternative to the private sector. The different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 3 147 378 thousand) for Scenario 7, this means that this PPP option is still less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. The lower Value for Money when compared to Scenario 6 is due to the absence of Corporate Tax in this scenario (and subsequent revenue to the State). Carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 17.4% for Sc.7. The Equity IRR for Scenario 7 is 10.68% which is still on the low side and may require some additional support from the State (i.e., slightly more subsidies) depending on the competition amongst the private candidates.\nWe conclude that the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax is the option that could present the highest Value for Money for the public sector with 17.4% ensuring bankability for the private sector and affordability for the State.\nThe qualitative assessment of the VfM includes the review of the efficiencies that the SPV can provide, the existence of a competitive market, the possibility of risk transfer to the developer/investor and whether such risk transfer will be achieved within the life of the project. The qualitative VfM analysis answered a series of questions about the proposed project in relation to Viability, Desirability and Achievability.""

What percentage of the total sources is represented by equity for Scenario 3?,16%,"['Results of the financial models and Value for Money\nThe financial modelling of a PPP project aims to test the bankability of the project, i.e. its ability to attract private financing with its two components: debt and equity. This financing resources could be completed by a possible contribution of the State in the investment cost financing through subsidies or donor grants e.g. green economy funding.\nThe following general assumptions were used in the model:\nDuration of the PPP contract: 25 years\nDuration of construction period: 2 years\nConstruction profile per year:\nAverage amortization period: 23 years\nThe following financial structure assumptions were used in the model:\nEquity: 40% of total debt and equity\nDebt: 60% of total debt and equity\nDebt maturity: 23 years\nInterest rate (private sector): 18%\nInterest rate (public sector): 28%\nGrace period: 2 years\nReimbursement method: constant P+I\nWe have considered two options: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR (Average Debt Service Coverage Ratio), if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have only considered market rents.\nWe have assumed that the private partner will not pay any royalty (or concession) fee to the public partner.\nThis combination of different options has resulted in the following 3 scenarios as requested by the MITC and PPPCU following the submission of the draft feasibility and meeting dated 16th of April 2023:\nScenario 0: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT inclusive, with a lower inflation during construction (12%), with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in a low equity IRR (1.26%) and a low ADSCR (0.67 for which there’s a debt default), which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 1: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT exclusive, with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in a low equity IRR (1.32%) and a low ADSCR (0.68 for which there’s a debt default), which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 2: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT exclusive, with Market Rents and with a revised design (8 floors): In this scenario, the project presents an equity IRR of 1.93% and an ADSCR of 0.72 (for which there’s a debt default which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 3: DBFOT with subsidy, VAT inclusive, with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 60% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 14.42% and Minimum ADSC is 1.70 which is attractive to the private sector.\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 63.7% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 17.07% and Minimum ADSC is 1.93 which is attractive to the private sector. Without a public subsidy, the Equity IRR would be at 0.93% and Minimum ADSC at 0.65, which means that the project will not attract private investors and will not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 61.4% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 17.21% and Minimum ADSC is 1.93 which is attractive to the private sector. Without a public subsidy, the Equity IRR would be at 1.59% and Minimum ADSC at 0.70, which means that the project will not attract private investors and will not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario assumes (following the recommendation of the MITC) subsidies amounting to 40% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 7.68% and Minimum ADSC is 1.16 which will not attract the private sector. In order to enhance the Equity IRR to 17%, we suggest an exoneration from the corporation tax during the entire contract period which results is an increased Equity IRR at 10.63%.\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included-No Corporate Tax: This scenario assumes subsidies amounting to 40% of the CAPEX but with no corporate tax. In this case, Equity IRR is 10.63% and Minimum ADSC is 1.16 which is better than Scenario 6 but is still on the low range for acceptable IRRs.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to four Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:'

 'Results of the financial modelling of the different project delivery models\nThe financial modelling of a PPP project aims to test the bankability of the project, i.e., its ability to attract private financing with its two components: debt and equity. This financing resources could be completed by a possible contribution of the Public Sector in the investment cost financing through subsidies.\nAssumptions of the model\nThe following general assumptions were used in the model:\nDuration of the PPP contract: 25 years\nDuration of construction period: 2 years\nConstruction profile per year:\nAverage amortization period: 23 years.\nThe following financial structure assumptions were used in the model:\nEquity: 40% of total debt and equity\nDebt: 60% of total debt and equity\nDebt maturity: 23 years\nInterest rate (private sector): 18%\nInterest rate (public sector): 28%\nGrace period: 2 years\nReimbursement method: constant P+I (Principal + Debt).\nEquity is provided by private investors (also called shareholders) who are often promoters, operating companies as well as specialized investment funds seeking long-term profitability (e.g., pension funds). These equity capitals usually represent about 30% of private financing. In the event of early termination of the PPP contract, this equity is not recoverable. In this financial modelling, we take a percentage of 40% as input data.\nDebt is provided by commercial banks and lenders. Debt usually accounts for about 70% of private financing. In the event of early termination of the PPP contract, the principal of the debt is “reimbursed” to the banks by the Public Sector. In this financial modelling, we take a percentage of 60% as input data.\nThe investment grant may be necessary to supplement the private financing of the PPP project and achieve full financing of the investment cost. In this financial modelling, we calculate the subsidy as a percentage of the investment cost. We vary this percentage manually until we reach a sufficient level of profitability for the shareholders (the key measurement indicator is the IRR of the shareholders (equity IRR) which must be greater than 15%) while respecting a debt service coverage ratio (Average Debt Coverage Ratio or ADSCR of at least 1.2).\nThe maturity of the debt is the period after which the debt is completely repaid. This duration is 3 years less than the contract duration. This is a requirement made by the banks to have a margin of manoeuvre of 3 years in case of an event hindering the progress of the contract (delay during the construction period, force majeure event, etc.).\nThe grace period is the period during which the project company does not repay any debt annuity to the banks. It is fixed at 2 years to cover the construction period, which means that the first annuity is paid at the end of the first year of operation.\nThe chosen reimbursement method is constant P+I. The other possible modality is linear depreciation. For the P+I, P means the principal of the debt and I means the interest of the debt. Since this quantity is constant, it implies that the project company pays a lot of interest at the start (“little” principal) and little interest at the end of the contract (a “lot” of principal). The P+I method is often preferred by investors because it allows a constant annuity.\nThe other macroeconomic assumptions of the project are:\nAnnual inflation (during the project period): 15%;\nVAT Rate: 16.5%; and\nCorporate income rate: 30%.'

 ""The Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 974 485  thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the fact that 4 floors do not allow an economy of scale that absorbs the risks that are still borne by the public authority. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. The reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost as opposed to the Public Sector by 13.4 % for the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\nThe Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 040 216   thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). The same explanation applies as for the previous scenario but to  a lesser extent as there are two more floors (6 instead of 4).

This “improved” Value for Money as opposed to Scenario 3 is mainly explained by the fact that Scenario 6’s PSC generates less revenue to the Procuring Authority which increases it’s gap with the PPP scenario. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 31.2% for Sc.6. The private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals.

This high Value for Money should be tempered by the fact that the Equity IRR for Scenario 6 is only 7.78% which is not sufficiently attractive for the private sector.\nScenario 7 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., subsidies at 40% and no Corporate Tax, is a variation of Scenario 6 that is meant to provide an attractive alternative to the private sector. The different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 3 147 378 thousand) for Scenario 7, this means that this PPP option is still less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. The lower Value for Money when compared to Scenario 6 is due to the absence of Corporate Tax in this scenario (and subsequent revenue to the State). Carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 17.4% for Sc.7. The Equity IRR for Scenario 7 is 10.68% which is still on the low side and may require some additional support from the State (i.e., slightly more subsidies) depending on the competition amongst the private candidates.\nWe conclude that the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax is the option that could present the highest Value for Money for the public sector with 17.4% ensuring bankability for the private sector and affordability for the State.\nThe qualitative assessment of the VfM includes the review of the efficiencies that the SPV can provide, the existence of a competitive market, the possibility of risk transfer to the developer/investor and whether such risk transfer will be achieved within the life of the project.

 ""PSC 1: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) at Market Rents with no change in the design: In this scenario, the financing of the cost of construction is done through public loan which generates capitalised interests of MK 10 349 038 thousand.

This analysis can only be done for the realistic scenarios, i.e., those that are able to attract the private sector, in this case scenarios 3, 4 and 5.\nThe analysis and comparison of the financial profitability of the different options is ultimately measured by means of the VfM.\nIn order to assess the VfM of each Scenario, we use the results of the financial model which adopts the point of view of the MITC and the private partner by estimating, for each option, the overall cost of the project for the public sector over the project period.\nThis cost is then risk-adjusted, where the cost of risks borne by the public sector (and which have not been transferred to the private partner) is added.\nThe Value for Money is a percentage which indicates, in absolute terms, the increase in value offered by the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator.\nTo quantitatively assess the VfM, the financial model estimates the cost to the public authority for each scenario. The project costs, which are borne by the project company during the term of the contract, are risk-adjusted and then compared in terms of NPV (Net Present Value) to the costs of the risk-adjusted Public Sector Comparator.\nFor the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design 10 floors-with subsidy-VAT Included, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is PSC 1, the different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 4 048 699 thousand) for Scenario 3, this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. This is partly explained by the estimated value of the risks retained by the public authority, which is lower for the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator (where the public authority bears all the risks of the project). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 11.9% for Sc.3.

 ""As the Public Sector Comparator (PSC), the OPEX are summarised in the following table.\n\n\nMacro-Economic Forecasts\nInflation Rates, Interest Rates, Bond/Treasury Note Yields and Cash Flow Discount Factor\nReserve Bank of Malawi monetary policy is aimed at achieving price stability (low and stable inflation) in the economy by controlling growth in money supply through interest rates and reserve money. A major factor driving money supply growth hence inflation is Government deficit financing. Malawi's Inflation Rate in November 2022 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index – CPI) is 25.80%.\nIn the long-term, the Malawi Inflation Rate is projected to trend around 21.80% in 2023 and around 12.40% in 2024, according to Trading Economics.\nMalawi's annual Inflation Rates (CPI) and Government Deficit Financing have been as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistics Office Bulletins; Reserve Bank of Malawi Publications, Malawi Government Annual Economic Reports\nConsequent to the above, the following variables have been used in the financial forecasts where applicable as they currently prevail in the Economy:\nRetained annual inflation rate for the project period: 15%.\n10-Year Bond/Treasury Note Yield: 28.50% per annum. This has been as the Discount Factor to calculate present values of future cash flows. The yield has also been used as the Interest Rate on all Local Currency Long Term Debt that the Project will raise as part of its Capital Structure.\nReference Interest Rate: 17.30% per annum. This is the Interest Rate based on which commercial banks price their short-term credit facilities. Normally a risk premium of up to 11.00% is added to determine the final price based on the risk profile of the customer. The Project has assumed a risk premium of 3.50% on all its Local Currency Short Term Debts.\nExchange Rates\nThe project has assumed a reference exchange rate of 1029 MK/ $ (November 2022) for the calculation of all the costs.\nThe Malawi Kwacha has traditionally depreciated against major convertible currencies, particularly the US Dollar, due to the persistent balance of payments deficits that the country runs.\nOver the past 10 years, the Malawi Kwacha has depreciated as follows against the US Dollar.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi\nThe Project has consequently assumed an annual depreciation rate of 10.6% in the value of the Kwacha in converting all foreign currency capital and operating expenditure items; and all foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that the Project may hold or assume.\nEconomic Growth\nThe growth of the economy which signals improved and increased economic activities hence increased demand for services, including rental space for businesses, has been based on estimated Gross Domestic Product [GDP] growth rate. Malawi's GDP (currently at US$ 12.5 billion) growth rate has been extrapolated based on the average 10-year real GDP growth rate as shown in the following table.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi, Financial and Economic Reviews; Malawi Government, Annual Economic Reports\nBased on the above, Malawi's economy is projected to grow by an average 4.0% per annum during the project forecast period.\nPopulation Growth\nPopulation growth rate, the productivity of that population, the age and gender mix of the population are also key drivers of economic activity in any country. The Malawi population has grown as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistical Office, World Bank\nThe Project has assumed an average annual population growth rate of 2.80% during the forecast period.\nShortlisted and selected PPP options\nA preliminary comparison between the different PPP options allowed by the PPP legal framework in Malawi has taken place in the Needs/Options Analysis Report through a multi-criteria assessment based on several criteria which should also be aligned with the objectives of the Malawian authorities.

Consequently, the plausible option lies within scenarios where the investor will organize funding for the investment, build and operate it.\nMITC should make project land “available” for development to the SPV without necessarily assigning “Title” to the SPV.

 'Results of the financial models and Value for Money\nThe financial modelling of a PPP project aims to test the bankability of the project, i.e. its ability to attract private financing with its two components: debt and equity. This financing resources could be completed by a possible contribution of the State in the investment cost financing through subsidies or donor grants e.g. green economy funding.\nThe following general assumptions were used in the model:\nDuration of the PPP contract: 25 years\nDuration of construction period: 2 years\nConstruction profile per year:\nAverage amortization period: 23 years\nThe following financial structure assumptions were used in the model:\nEquity: 40% of total debt and equity\nDebt: 60% of total debt and equity\nDebt maturity: 23 years\nInterest rate (private sector): 18%\nInterest rate (public sector): 28%\nGrace period: 2 years\nReimbursement method: constant P+I\nWe have considered two options: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR (Average Debt Service Coverage Ratio), if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have only considered market rents.\nWe have assumed that the private partner will not pay any royalty (or concession) fee to the public partner.\nThis combination of different options has resulted in the following 3 scenarios as requested by the MITC and PPPCU following the submission of the draft feasibility and meeting dated 16th of April 2023:\nScenario 0: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT inclusive, with a lower inflation during construction (12%), with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in a low equity IRR (1.26%) and a low ADSCR (0.67 for which there’s a debt default), which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 1: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT exclusive, with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in a low equity IRR (1.32%) and a low ADSCR (0.68 for which there’s a debt default), which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 2: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT exclusive, with Market Rents and with a revised design (8 floors): In this scenario, the project presents an equity IRR of 1.93% and an ADSCR of 0.72 (for which there’s a debt default which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 3: DBFOT with subsidy, VAT inclusive, with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 60% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 14.42% and Minimum ADSC is 1.70 which is attractive to the private sector.\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 63.7% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 17.07% and Minimum ADSC is 1.93 which is attractive to the private sector. Without a public subsidy, the Equity IRR would be at 0.93% and Minimum ADSC at 0.65, which means that the project will not attract private investors and will not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 61.4% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 17.21% and Minimum ADSC is 1.93 which is attractive to the private sector. Without a public subsidy, the Equity IRR would be at 1.59% and Minimum ADSC at 0.70, which means that the project will not attract private investors and will not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario assumes (following the recommendation of the MITC) subsidies amounting to 40% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 7.68% and Minimum ADSC is 1.16 which will not attract the private sector. In order to enhance the Equity IRR to 17%, we suggest an exoneration from the corporation tax during the entire contract period which results is an increased Equity IRR at 10.63%.\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included-No Corporate Tax: This scenario assumes subsidies amounting to 40% of the CAPEX but with no corporate tax. In this case, Equity IRR is 10.63% and Minimum ADSC is 1.16 which is better than Scenario 6 but is still on the low range for acceptable IRRs.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to four Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:']","[""Types 3, 4, and 6 PPP options were chosen for further analysis after a preliminary comparison of the various PPP options permitted by Malawi's PPP legal framework.

What is the main reason for the negative Value for Money in Scenario 4 and 5?,"The main reason for the negative Value for Money in Scenario 4 and 5 is that the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks that are still borne by the public authority less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. This means that the PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator).","[""The Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 974 485  thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the fact that 4 floors do not allow an economy of scale that absorbs the risks that are still borne by the public authority. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. The reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost as opposed to the Public Sector by 13.4 % for the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\nThe Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 040 216   thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). The same explanation applies as for the previous scenario but to  a lesser extent as there are two more floors (6 instead of 4). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost for the Public Sector by 5.7% for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 6 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc. and subsidies at 40%, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is also PSC 4, the different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 5 636 716 thousand) for Scenario 6, this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. This “improved” Value for Money as opposed to Scenario 3 is mainly explained by the fact that Scenario 6’s PSC generates less revenue to the Procuring Authority which increases it’s gap with the PPP scenario. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 31.2% for Sc.6. The private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues are used to pay the operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and dividends. This high Value for Money should be tempered by the fact that the Equity IRR for Scenario 6 is only 7.78% which is not sufficiently attractive for the private sector.\nScenario 7 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., subsidies at 40% and no Corporate Tax, is a variation of Scenario 6 that is meant to provide an attractive alternative to the private sector. The different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 3 147 378 thousand) for Scenario 7, this means that this PPP option is still less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. The lower Value for Money when compared to Scenario 6 is due to the absence of Corporate Tax in this scenario (and subsequent revenue to the State). Carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 17.4% for Sc.7. The Equity IRR for Scenario 7 is 10.68% which is still on the low side and may require some additional support from the State (i.e., slightly more subsidies) depending on the competition amongst the private candidates.\nWe conclude that the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax is the option that could present the highest Value for Money for the public sector with 17.4% ensuring bankability for the private sector and affordability for the State.\nThe qualitative assessment of the VfM includes the review of the efficiencies that the SPV can provide, the existence of a competitive market, the possibility of risk transfer to the developer/investor and whether such risk transfer will be achieved within the life of the project. The qualitative VfM analysis answered a series of questions about the proposed project in relation to Viability, Desirability and Achievability.""

What are the two main categories of risks identified in the project?,General risks or country risks and Project-specific risks,"[""Comprehensive Risk Assessment\nIntroduction\nRisk can be defined very briefly as a “volatility of outcomes”. Risk analysis focuses on the probability that events do not occur as planned and measurement of the consequences of such failure. The methodology followed during risk analysis includes risk identification, quantification and allocation during the Feasibility Study, Pre-procurement, Procurement and Evaluation stages of the Project.\nThis section sets out a number of principles that should guide risk analysis and risk allocation. It also identifies the main risks of the project and proposes their allocation. Some aspects that can significantly influence the assessment of risks and their perception by investors are also presented.\nPrinciples to guide the analysis and allocation of project risks\nEach project has its specific risk profile with characteristics linked to the context of the country, the sector or specific to the project. Thus, the risk analysis must identify the various risks of the project and allocate them in an effective way between the stakeholders in the project.\nEach identified risk must be allocated to the party that is best able to manage it, control it and control its cost.\nA party's comparative advantage in bearing a risk may result from having more information about the risk and its impact and being able to influence the outcome.\nA non-optimal allocation of risks, for example by transferring to the private sector a risk that it cannot assume, will increase the cost of the project or even limit the participation of candidates from the private sector if the risk is perceived as prohibitive by investors. In the absence of an acceptable mitigation of risks beyond its control, the private operator will aim for profits in relation to the risks allocated to it and will ask for significant guarantees in exchange. Thus, the promoter will “monetize” his perception and his assessment of the risks of the project.\nFinally, risk mitigation strategies should also be assessed in terms of cost/benefit as the cost of extensive mitigation may exceed the expected benefits.\nRisk identification\nFor the project consisting of designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining the MITC office complex, the risks can be classified into two main categories:\nGeneral risks or country risks which are linked to the political, economic and legal environment of the country and over which the two partners have no control; and\nProject-specific risks over which the public and the private partners may have some control.\nThe table below summarizes the main risks of the project.\n\n\nRisk matrix and Risk allocation\nThe Risk Matrix includes the key risks that may impact the project as well as the adopted approach of managing and mitigating these risks in similar projects undertaken in the region and internationally.\nThis risk matrix is not intended to be a complete or exhaustive matrix of legal risks  but is designed to pre-treat the commercial and contractual relations proposed to be put in place between the MITC and the private partner. It highlights any specific concerns, obstacles or constraints impacting the project as well as the proposed risk allocation based on appropriate benchmarks for the standard allocation of these risks in similar regional or international PPP projects.\nThe risk matrix of the project including the different risks allocation, mitigation and coverage is presented in the following table.\n\n\n\nRisk quantification\nIntroduction\nRisk is quantified by measuring the potential to incur (additional) costs above baseline costs. The quantification of risks is not usual for traditional public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator) which tend to suffer from an optimism bias, i.e., a tendency to budget for the best possible outcome (often the least costly) rather than the most probable. This leads to frequent cost (and time) overruns.\nMoreover, the risks associated with the project do not disappear because the private sector provides the service under a PPP contract. However, the quantification (and therefore provision) of these risks is often lower for the private sector, as these risks tend to be better managed (than by the public sector), mainly due to a better distribution of risks and economies of scale generated by the PPP and expertise in risk management.\nMethodology\nThe first step is to determine the cost to the Public Sector of each identified risk, depending on whether the Project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP. This cost is calculated as follows:""

 'Risk Analysis\nRisk analysis focuses on the probability that events do not occur as planned and measurement of the consequences of such failure. The methodology followed during risk analysis includes risk identification, quantification and allocation during the Feasibility Study, Pre-procurement and Procurement and Evaluation stages of the Project.\nFor the project consisting of designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining the MITC office complex, the risks can be classified into two main categories:\nGeneral risks or country risks which are linked to the political, economic and legal environment of the country and over which the two partners have no control; and\nProject-specific risks over which the public and the private partners may have some control.\nThe table below summarizes the main risks of the project.\nThe Risk Matrix includes the key risks that may impact the project as well as the adopted approach of managing and mitigating these risks in similar projects undertaken in the region and internationally.\nRisk is quantified by measuring the potential to incur (additional) costs above baseline costs.\nThe first step is to determine the cost to the State of each identified risk, depending on whether the Project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP. This cost is calculated as follows:\n\nWhere:\n= Probability of occurrence of risk n\n= Reference value or base cost defined for risk n – established for each risk according to its nature\n= Share of the risk borne by the public sector or the cost of the impact – varies according to the option considered (Public Sector Comparator or PPP).\nThe risks are classified according to the stages of the project in which they occur, namely:\nPlanning\nProcurement\nDesign\nConstruction\nOperating period which includes both operation and maintenance of the infrastructure\nRenewal and transfer (handover) period that takes into account life cycle expenses and handover of infrastructure at contract expiration.\nRisks at each of the above project stages will be subdivided into the following sub-categories:\nTechnical – covering aspects such as asset efficiency, durability and achievement of specifications\nLegal - covering aspects related to changes in laws or compliance with existing laws and regulations\nCommercial - covering aspects related to input prices, general availability of inputs as well as insurability of risks\nFinancial/monetary – covering aspects related to the impact of changes in key financial variables such as inflation, interest rate and exchange rate, public financing shortfall, private financing shortfall, debt default, remuneration\nPolitical/social - covering aspects related to social unrest, civil unrest, industrial strikes, terrorism, etc.\nEnvironmental - covering aspects related to the environmental issues that could be faced by the project.\nAs for the probability of occurrence and the rank, it is the probability that a risk occurs and is described as a percentage and a descriptive rank.\nThe financial impact of a risk (share of the risk borne by the public sector) is assessed according to three scenarios: Maximum, Medium and Minimum impact scenario, reflecting cost impact as a result of the risk occurrence.\n\nCost, revenue and economic assumptions\nBesides the initial design, three additional design scenarios have been requested by the MITC for the office complex.\nAccording to the initial base design, the building will be built on 11 floors, as well as a basement (~3 690 m2) and a ground floor (~1’228 m2). The area of the total building is estimated at 16 365 square meters, of which 9 940 square meters are allocated to lettable and the MITC useable areas. The overall construction cost for this scenario is estimated at MK 37 047 288\xa0000, which is equivalent to US$ 36 003 195 in November 2022 exchange rates.\nThe following table summarises the features and costs of the three additional design propositions.'

 'Results of the financial modelling of the different project delivery models\nThe financial modelling of a PPP project aims to test the bankability of the project, i.e., its ability to attract private financing with its two components: debt and equity. This financing resources could be completed by a possible contribution of the Public Sector in the investment cost financing through subsidies.\nAssumptions of the model\nThe following general assumptions were used in the model:\nDuration of the PPP contract: 25 years\nDuration of construction period: 2 years\nConstruction profile per year:\nAverage amortization period: 23 years.\nThe following financial structure assumptions were used in the model:\nEquity: 40% of total debt and equity\nDebt: 60% of total debt and equity\nDebt maturity: 23 years\nInterest rate (private sector): 18%\nInterest rate (public sector): 28%\nGrace period: 2 years\nReimbursement method: constant P+I (Principal + Debt).\nEquity is provided by private investors (also called shareholders) who are often promoters, operating companies as well as specialized investment funds seeking long-term profitability (e.g., pension funds). These equity capitals usually represent about 30% of private financing. In the event of early termination of the PPP contract, this equity is not recoverable. In this financial modelling, we take a percentage of 40% as input data.\nDebt is provided by commercial banks and lenders. Debt usually accounts for about 70% of private financing. In the event of early termination of the PPP contract, the principal of the debt is “reimbursed” to the banks by the Public Sector. In this financial modelling, we take a percentage of 60% as input data.\nThe investment grant may be necessary to supplement the private financing of the PPP project and achieve full financing of the investment cost. In this financial modelling, we calculate the subsidy as a percentage of the investment cost. We vary this percentage manually until we reach a sufficient level of profitability for the shareholders (the key measurement indicator is the IRR of the shareholders (equity IRR) which must be greater than 15%) while respecting a debt service coverage ratio (Average Debt Coverage Ratio or ADSCR of at least 1.2).\nThe maturity of the debt is the period after which the debt is completely repaid. This duration is 3 years less than the contract duration. This is a requirement made by the banks to have a margin of manoeuvre of 3 years in case of an event hindering the progress of the contract (delay during the construction period, force majeure event, etc.).\nThe grace period is the period during which the project company does not repay any debt annuity to the banks. It is fixed at 2 years to cover the construction period, which means that the first annuity is paid at the end of the first year of operation.\nThe chosen reimbursement method is constant P+I. The other possible modality is linear depreciation. For the P+I, P means the principal of the debt and I means the interest of the debt. Since this quantity is constant, it implies that the project company pays a lot of interest at the start (“little” principal) and little interest at the end of the contract (a “lot” of principal). The P+I method is often preferred by investors because it allows a constant annuity.\nThe other macroeconomic assumptions of the project are:\nAnnual inflation (during the project period): 15%;\nVAT Rate: 16.5%; and\nCorporate income rate: 30%.'

 'Results of the financial models and Value for Money\nThe financial modelling of a PPP project aims to test the bankability of the project, i.e. its ability to attract private financing with its two components: debt and equity. This financing resources could be completed by a possible contribution of the State in the investment cost financing through subsidies or donor grants e.g. green economy funding.\nThe following general assumptions were used in the model:\nDuration of the PPP contract: 25 years\nDuration of construction period: 2 years\nConstruction profile per year:\nAverage amortization period: 23 years\nThe following financial structure assumptions were used in the model:\nEquity: 40% of total debt and equity\nDebt: 60% of total debt and equity\nDebt maturity: 23 years\nInterest rate (private sector): 18%\nInterest rate (public sector): 28%\nGrace period: 2 years\nReimbursement method: constant P+I\nWe have considered two options: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR (Average Debt Service Coverage Ratio), if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have only considered market rents.\nWe have assumed that the private partner will not pay any royalty (or concession) fee to the public partner.\nThis combination of different options has resulted in the following 3 scenarios as requested by the MITC and PPPCU following the submission of the draft feasibility and meeting dated 16th of April 2023:\nScenario 0: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT inclusive, with a lower inflation during construction (12%), with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in a low equity IRR (1.26%) and a low ADSCR (0.67 for which there’s a debt default), which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 1: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT exclusive, with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in a low equity IRR (1.32%) and a low ADSCR (0.68 for which there’s a debt default), which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 2: DBFOT without subsidy, VAT exclusive, with Market Rents and with a revised design (8 floors): In this scenario, the project presents an equity IRR of 1.93% and an ADSCR of 0.72 (for which there’s a debt default which means that implementing the project through this scenario does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 3: DBFOT with subsidy, VAT inclusive, with Market Rents and with no change in the design: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 60% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 14.42% and Minimum ADSC is 1.70 which is attractive to the private sector.\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 63.7% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 17.07% and Minimum ADSC is 1.93 which is attractive to the private sector. Without a public subsidy, the Equity IRR would be at 0.93% and Minimum ADSC at 0.65, which means that the project will not attract private investors and will not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario results in subsidies amounting to 61.4% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 17.21% and Minimum ADSC is 1.93 which is attractive to the private sector. Without a public subsidy, the Equity IRR would be at 1.59% and Minimum ADSC at 0.70, which means that the project will not attract private investors and will not allow to pay the annual debt service.\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included: This scenario assumes (following the recommendation of the MITC) subsidies amounting to 40% of the CAPEX. In this case, Equity IRR is 7.68% and Minimum ADSC is 1.16 which will not attract the private sector. In order to enhance the Equity IRR to 17%, we suggest an exoneration from the corporation tax during the entire contract period which results is an increased Equity IRR at 10.63%.\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included-No Corporate Tax: This scenario assumes subsidies amounting to 40% of the CAPEX but with no corporate tax. In this case, Equity IRR is 10.63% and Minimum ADSC is 1.16 which is better than Scenario 6 but is still on the low range for acceptable IRRs.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to four Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:'
 'EPC contracts are a simpler and proven procurement route easier than PPP contracts which can be considered as more complex. Whilst the EPC route provides a simple contractual framework and fast procurement process, it requires the underlying infrastructure to be entirely funded during the construction period by the public sector. Moreover, the risk profile of an EPC contract is less favourable to the public sector as the main risks (such as cost overruns, delays and interfaces) are not transferred to the contractors. Furthermore, the term of an EPC contract is limited to the construction period of the asset with possible negative impacts on the whole life cost of the infrastructure.\nConversely, PPP contracts require relatively long procurement periods in order to address the inherent complexity arising from the necessity to assess and allocate project risks between the public and private sectors. Furthermore, PPP contracts allow the public sector to rely on private funders (lenders and investors) to partly fund the capital investment costs during the construction period. PPP contracts encourage contractors to adopt a whole life cost approach to the development of the infrastructure. \nEPC contracts are commonly adopted in the development of real estate projects. Under an EPC contract, an entity is contracted to design and construct a piece of infrastructure system. Payment is usually based on a fixed lump sum price basis, but incentives, such as milestone payments or target costs (e.g. gain / pain share mechanisms) can be built in into the contract. \nFor the purposes of the Project, it is important to highlight two key differences between EPC contract and a PPP contract:\nNo private funding - under an EPC contract, the public entity would need to pay the contractor at construction milestones. The public entity should therefore have access to sufficient funds to do so.\nNo post-construction maintenance responsibility - under an EPC contract, the contractor is not usually responsible for maintenance of the asset post-completion. The public contractor would need to enter into a separate maintenance contract for the infrastructure.\nUnder a PPP contract, the contractor is responsible for the design, construction, maintenance, whole life cost and funding of the infrastructure. The contractor\'s key obligation is to make the infrastructure ""available"" to the public contractor through a fixed operational term (typically 20-25 years).'

 ""Value for Money Assessment\nIntroduction\nThe Value for Money (hereafter “VfM”) analysis consists of carrying out an assessment of the overall cost of the project, taking into account the value of the inherent risks, depending on whether the project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP.\nThe analysis and comparison of the financial profitability of different options is ultimately measured by means of the VfM. In order to assess the VfM of each option, we use the results of the financial model which adopts the point of view of the MITC and the private partner by estimating the overall cost of the project for the public sector of each option over the project duration.\nThis cost is then risk-adjusted, i.e., the cost of risks borne by the public sector (and which have not been transferred to the private partner) is added. The cost of risks is provided by the risk register, the results of which are in Appendix 3 section.\nBest practice in financial analysis and modelling requires that a set of different options and sensitivities be evaluated and compared.\nThe Value for Money is a percentage which indicates in absolute terms the increase in value offered by the PPP option compared to the public procurement option, i.e., an option where the project is carried out with one or more traditional procurement models.\nThe Value for Money for the PPP option is achieved through the commitment of efficiency, effectiveness and savings that can be achieved by the private sector and the appropriate allocation of risk in the project. Factors that determine whether the VfM of a PPP option is positive include:\nA better distribution of risks which are allocated to the counterparty that is the best to manage it;\nLong-term contract: predictability of costs and revenues for counterparties;\nCall for tenders implemented quickly;\nImproved quality of service;\nCompensation structure based on performance incentives; and\nReduction of costs over the life cycle of the project thanks to an optimization of the maintenance of the infrastructures.\nQuantitative assessment\nIn order to quantitatively assess the VfM, the financial model estimates the cost to the public authority for each option. The project costs, which are borne by the project company during the term of the contract, are risk-adjusted and then compared in terms of NPV to the costs of the risk-adjusted Public Sector Comparator. In the following section, we present the results of this analysis. The different total costs of the project for the Public Sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down below. We remind that the Value for Money only makes sense for PPP scenario that are bankable (Debt is paid with DSCR >1.2) and attractive to investors (Equity IRR > 15%).\nValue for Money for the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included)\nFor the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design 10 floors-with subsidy-VAT Included, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is PSC 1, the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\n\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 4 048 699    thousand) for Sc.3-DBFOT-Init. Design-with subs.-VAT Inc., this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the estimated value of the risks retained by the public authority, which is lower for the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator (where the public authority bears all the risks of the project). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the Public Sector by 11.9% for Sc. 3: DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included.\nThe private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues cover operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, equity, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and expenses are investment costs (CAPEX) and capitalized interest.\nThe revenues of the Public Sector in the PPP options are mainly taxes generated from the operation of the project.\nValue for Money for the Scenario 4 (DBFOT-Revised design 4 floors-with subs.-VAT Inc.)\nFor the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:""

 'Selected scenarios\nSeveral cases of calculation could be envisaged in order to verify the criteria for evaluating the financial profitability of the project by varying the rents/revenue and/or the level of subsidy paid by the Public Sector to the private partner.\nIt should be noted that the definition of the subsidy rate on a new infrastructure implemented through PPP should result from a financial calculation with a view to ensuring that the operating revenues make it possible to generate sufficient cash flow to recover investment costs, repay debts, cover operating, maintenance and necessary renewals expenses, and appropriately remunerate the capital employed.\nWe have considered two scenarios: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR, if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have also considered only one scenario based on market rentals.\nAs for the annual royalty fee (or concession fee or lease fee) paid by the private partner to the MITC as a percentage of the total revenue, we have assumed that it is equal to Zero.\nThis combination of different possibilities resulted in 6 possible scenarios for the PPP option, namely:\nScenario 0: DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation;\nScenario 1: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) without subsidy-VAT Excluded;\nScenario 2: DBFOT-Revised Design (8 floors) without subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 3: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included; and\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included-No corporate tax.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to two Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:\nPSC 1: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Initial Design (10 floors);\nPSC 2: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (8 floors).\nPSC 3: Public Sector Comparator 3 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (4 floors); and\nPSC 4: Public Sector Comparator 4 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (6 floors).\n\nSc. 0-DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation\nFor this scenario, there is no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost and the rental fees for the offices (per SQM).\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37 047 288 thousand (2022 terms). By applying inflation during the construction period (12% during the construction period), we obtain the amount of MK 49,260,445 thousand.\nThe financing of the cost of construction is done partly by private debt which generates capitalised interests of MK 4,866,530 thousand. The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 54,126,975 thousand.\nThis amount is financed by debt up to MK 34,422,797 thousand, equity up to MK 19,704,178 thousand and with no subsidy.\n\nThe revenue curve corresponds to the revenue generated by the project, i.e., rental income from office space and car slots. In this case, the private partner is remunerated directly by the tenants.\n\nThe revenues of the public sector come from taxes collected (VAT, income tax, etc.), from which is deducted the amount of rental paid by the MITC to the private partner for its allocated space.\nThis scenario presents a low equity IRR (1.26%) and a low ADSCR (0.67), which means that implementing the project through this format does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service. For these reasons, this scenario has been eliminated from the financial modelling of the Value for Money.\nSc. 1-DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Exclusive\nFor this scenario, there is also no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost and the rental fees for the offices (per SQM).\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37,047,288 thousand (2022 terms). By applying inflation during the construction period (15%), we obtain the amount of MK 52,669,666 thousand.\nThe financing of the cost of construction is done partly by private debt which generates capitalised interests of MK 5,166,666 thousand. The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 57,836,333 thousand.\nThis amount is financed by debt up to MK 36,768,466 thousand, equity up to MK 21,067,867 thousand and with no subsidy.\n \nThe revenue curve corresponds to the revenue generated by the project, i.e., rental income from office space and car slots.

What is the total cost of the project at the end of the construction period for PSC 2?,MK 47 323 588 thousand,"[""PSC 1: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) at Market Rents with no change in the design: In this scenario, the financing of the cost of construction is done through public loan which generates capitalised interests of MK 10 349 038 thousand. The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 63 018 704 thousand, financed entirely by public debt.\nPSC 2: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) at Market Rents with a revised design (8 floors): In this scenario, the financing of the cost of construction is done through public loan which generates capitalised interests of MK 7 771 560 thousand.

The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 26 123 328 thousand, financed entirely by public debt.\nPSC 4: Public Sector Comparator 4 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (6 floors): In this scenario, the financing of the cost of construction is done through public loan which generates capitalised interests of MK 6 208 402 thousand. The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 34 244 887 thousand, financed entirely by public debt.\nThe Value for money (hereafter “VfM”) analysis consists in carrying out an assessment of the overall cost of the project, taking into account the value of the inherent risks, depending on whether the project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP. This analysis can only be done for the realistic scenarios, i.e., those that are able to attract the private sector, in this case scenarios 3, 4 and 5.\nThe analysis and comparison of the financial profitability of the different options is ultimately measured by means of the VfM.\nIn order to assess the VfM of each Scenario, we use the results of the financial model which adopts the point of view of the MITC and the private partner by estimating, for each option, the overall cost of the project for the public sector over the project period.\nThis cost is then risk-adjusted, where the cost of risks borne by the public sector (and which have not been transferred to the private partner) is added.\nThe Value for Money is a percentage which indicates, in absolute terms, the increase in value offered by the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator.\nTo quantitatively assess the VfM, the financial model estimates the cost to the public authority for each scenario. The project costs, which are borne by the project company during the term of the contract, are risk-adjusted and then compared in terms of NPV (Net Present Value) to the costs of the risk-adjusted Public Sector Comparator.\nFor the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design 10 floors-with subsidy-VAT Included, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is PSC 1, the different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 4 048 699 thousand) for Scenario 3, this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. This is partly explained by the estimated value of the risks retained by the public authority, which is lower for the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator (where the public authority bears all the risks of the project). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 11.9% for Sc.3. The private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues are used to pay the operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and dividends.\nThe private partner's revenues stop from 2049 because it is the last year of the PPP (We have assumed a duration of the PPP of 25 years starting from 2024). The revenues of the State in the PPP options are mainly taxes generated from the operation of the project.\nAs for the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:""

 'The cycle of PPP contracts in Malawi initiated by the public authorities goes through 5 phases:\n\n\nSource: Author\nIn the first phase, the PPP committee or the contracting public authority, with the support of the PPP committee, identifies the project to be implemented as a PPP, either by itself or jointly with another person or contracting authority. To this end, a Needs and Options Analysis is carried out in order to determine whether the PPP is the best solution for providing the envisaged service or infrastructure to be set up through the project in relation to other public procurement processes.\nThe conduct of this analysis is followed by the completion of a pre-feasibility study and an initial viability analysis of the Project. The pre-feasibility study indicates the possible location(s), route(s) and general cost estimates of the project and an initial indication of the likelihood of the project being viable and affordable. \nIn coordination with the Review and Authorisation Unit of the Ministry of Finance, the PPP Commission determines the requirements for the pre-feasibility study and decides whether a full feasibility study should be carried out for the project.\nIn the second phase, the contracting authority carries out a technical, financial and legal feasibility study, either through the PPP Commission or by itself when authorised by the Commission. The purpose of this study is to enable the government to assess whether the project to be carried out is sound and whether it meets the criteria of viability, risk, bankability, accessibility and appropriateness set by the government. The feasibility study should show that delivering the project as a PPP offers competitive advantages, that the PPP is the most appropriate instrument for delivering the project, that it is affordable for the contracting authority, that it offers good value for money, and that it transfers technical, financial or operational risks to the private contractor. It should also demonstrate the capacity of the contracting authority to implement the contract effectively and specify the role and functions to be performed by the public authority in setting up and implementing the agreement.\nThe next phase for project implementation is the procurement phase to select the private partner best suited to implement and execute the project. The Commission considers carrying out a pre-qualification exercise to select potential bidders or may delegate the carrying out of the pre-qualification to the contracting authority when it considers that the contracting authority has the necessary expertise to undertake this step.\nThe invitation to tenderers to submit tenders is made through the tender document which is prepared by the Commission, and which includes a public invitation to pre-qualified tenderers to submit tenders.\nIn evaluating the bids submitted, the PPP committee ensures that all bidders have equal opportunities and that their bids are treated fairly. To this end, the tender must clearly state the evaluation criteria that will be used as a basis for the evaluation of the bids. \nAfter the selection phase, the fourth phase involves drawing up the final PPP contract and signing it with the selected bidder. The public-private partnership contract may only be concluded on the basis of a decision of the PPP Committee, after obtaining the consent of the Minister of Finance and his agreement on the final version of the contract to be signed. Within thirty days from the date of receipt of the final draft contract, the PPP Committee must decide on the granting of consent for the text of the draft contract.\nIn the last and fifth phase, the implementation and evaluation of the contract, the contracting authority, supported by the PPP commission, carries out an evaluation of the entire PPP project, from project identification to implementation, in order to assess the timeliness and effectiveness of the project.'
 'With the increased amount of lettable space there would be a number of parameters which would also increase such as increased number of car-parking spaces required, size of passenger lifts in terms of the number of stops, and associated costs.\nThe result of the above options would lead to an increase in the scope of works whilst increasing the costing and would most likely also take longer to construct. This in turn would mean MITC would be forced to occupy the building later than the current estimated time with the current size. The legal and regulatory framework governing the conduct of environmental and social impact assessment include the Environment Management Act No. 19 of 2017, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development to which Malawi is a signatory and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Malawi. An environmental and social impact assessment involves the systemic evaluation of a project to determine its impact on the physical, ecological environmental and the conservation of natural resources on the social and socio-economic fabric of a particular community and any social change process that may be associated with a project. Consequently, a project is to be planned, designed and implemented in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on the biophysical and socio-economic environment.\nSection 31 of the Environment Management Act provides that the Minister may specify the type and size of the project which shall not be implemented unless an environmental and social impact assessment is carried out. The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment contain a list of infrastructure and land development projects that are subject to assessment and offices or compound building complexes are not listed. If a project is exempt, the Director of Environmental Affairs issues a certificate and advises a developer and relevant licensing authority of the exemption and any recommendations made.\nIn the implementation of the infrastructure project between MITC and a private party, an exemption certificate will need to be obtained.\nThe Feasibility Study aims to ensure that the most appropriate legal solutions are identified at an early stage by mapping and programming the procurement timetable by reference to applicable legislation and testing the commercial principles against their deliverability in a legal and regulatory context.\nThe legal, regulatory and policy framework for the project comprises the Republic of Malawi Constitution of 1994 as well as various legislations that cover public private partnerships, infrastructure development permits, real estate issues, foreign direct investments, controls on foreign exchange transactions, dividend repatriation and requirement for environmental and social impact assessments.\nThe legal framework for PPP in Malawi mainly consists of the Public-Private Partnership Act (the “PPP Act”) adopted on 22 December 2011, as well as the Public-Private Partnership Policy Framework, approved by Cabinet on 18 May 2011. The PPP Act has been appealed by the PPP Bill that was enacted into law by Parliament on the 5th of April 2022.\nThe PPP Law provides for the possibility to structure the Project through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) or a Joint Venture agreement (JV).\nThe law in Malawi provides for permits and approvals that are to be obtained before the implementation of an infrastructure development project, namely:\nPlanning Permission;\nDevelopment Permission; and\nCompliance with Development Guidelines and Standards.\nThe Project can be structured through a public private partnership or an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contract. The legal framework in Malawi allows both structures.\nThe cycle of PPP contracts in Malawi initiated by the public authorities goes through 5 phases as shown in the following figure.'

 ""As the Public Sector Comparator (PSC), the OPEX are summarised in the following table.\n\n\nMacro-Economic Forecasts\nInflation Rates, Interest Rates, Bond/Treasury Note Yields and Cash Flow Discount Factor\nReserve Bank of Malawi monetary policy is aimed at achieving price stability (low and stable inflation) in the economy by controlling growth in money supply through interest rates and reserve money. A major factor driving money supply growth hence inflation is Government deficit financing. Malawi's Inflation Rate in November 2022 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index – CPI) is 25.80%.\nIn the long-term, the Malawi Inflation Rate is projected to trend around 21.80% in 2023 and around 12.40% in 2024, according to Trading Economics.\nMalawi's annual Inflation Rates (CPI) and Government Deficit Financing have been as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistics Office Bulletins; Reserve Bank of Malawi Publications, Malawi Government Annual Economic Reports\nConsequent to the above, the following variables have been used in the financial forecasts where applicable as they currently prevail in the Economy:\nRetained annual inflation rate for the project period: 15%.\n10-Year Bond/Treasury Note Yield: 28.50% per annum. This has been as the Discount Factor to calculate present values of future cash flows. The yield has also been used as the Interest Rate on all Local Currency Long Term Debt that the Project will raise as part of its Capital Structure.\nReference Interest Rate: 17.30% per annum. This is the Interest Rate based on which commercial banks price their short-term credit facilities. Normally a risk premium of up to 11.00% is added to determine the final price based on the risk profile of the customer. The Project has assumed a risk premium of 3.50% on all its Local Currency Short Term Debts.\nExchange Rates\nThe project has assumed a reference exchange rate of 1029 MK/ $ (November 2022) for the calculation of all the costs.\nThe Malawi Kwacha has traditionally depreciated against major convertible currencies, particularly the US Dollar, due to the persistent balance of payments deficits that the country runs.\nOver the past 10 years, the Malawi Kwacha has depreciated as follows against the US Dollar.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi\nThe Project has consequently assumed an annual depreciation rate of 10.6% in the value of the Kwacha in converting all foreign currency capital and operating expenditure items; and all foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that the Project may hold or assume.\nEconomic Growth\nThe growth of the economy which signals improved and increased economic activities hence increased demand for services, including rental space for businesses, has been based on estimated Gross Domestic Product [GDP] growth rate. Malawi's GDP (currently at US$ 12.5 billion) growth rate has been extrapolated based on the average 10-year real GDP growth rate as shown in the following table.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi, Financial and Economic Reviews; Malawi Government, Annual Economic Reports\nBased on the above, Malawi's economy is projected to grow by an average 4.0% per annum during the project forecast period.\nPopulation Growth\nPopulation growth rate, the productivity of that population, the age and gender mix of the population are also key drivers of economic activity in any country. The Malawi population has grown as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistical Office, World Bank\nThe Project has assumed an average annual population growth rate of 2.80% during the forecast period.\nShortlisted and selected PPP options\nA preliminary comparison between the different PPP options allowed by the PPP legal framework in Malawi has taken place in the Needs/Options Analysis Report through a multi-criteria assessment based on several criteria which should also be aligned with the objectives of the Malawian authorities.

 'PPP Options\nA preliminary comparison between the different PPP options allowed by the PPP legal framework in Malawi has taken place in the Needs/Options Analysis Report through a multi-criteria assessment based on several criteria which should also be aligned with the objectives of the Malawian authorities.\nAfter discussions at the workshop held in Lilongwe on August 2nd, 2022 with MITC, it was agreed and resolved that the PPP options preferred for further scrutiny are Types 3 (Concession), Type 4 (BOT, BOOT) and 6 (Institutional PPP).\nBased on the client’s recommendations, the qualitative comparison, the outcomes of the benchmark study and project specific features, we recommend the following PPP delivery model for the implementation the Office Building:\nModel 1: implementing the project through a DBFOT (Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer) contract, where the private partner is responsible for the finance, design, construction under a turnkey risk basis, operating and maintenance of the project for a specified period, after which the project facilities are transferred to the Contracting Authority (MITC) without payment of any compensation. In this model, the Private Party collects tariffs or fees (rentals) directly from the users of the different components of the office complex (lettable offices and car slots), as specified in the PPP agreement, to recover its investment and operating and maintenance expenses for the project.\nAs for the Public-Sector Comparator (PSC) option (base case option), it is stated as follows:\nModel 2: implementing the project through:\nA Design-Build (DB) contract, also known as an EPC “Engineering, Procurement and Construction” contract, for which the MITC delegates to a private operator (ex: a construction company) the design and construction of the Office Building under public funding, which is then delivered “turnkey” to the public authority, according to a schedule and at a firm price.\nAn Operation & Maintenance (O&M) or Management contract, in which the MITC entrusts a private company with the operation and maintenance of the existing building (which was just constructed) in exchange for a remuneration from the Public Authority on the basis of a fixed or variable sum, generally depending on the achievement of performance objectives or a certain quality of service.'

 'Selected scenarios\nSeveral cases of calculation could be envisaged in order to verify the criteria for evaluating the financial profitability of the project by varying the rents/revenue and/or the level of subsidy paid by the Public Sector to the private partner.\nIt should be noted that the definition of the subsidy rate on a new infrastructure implemented through PPP should result from a financial calculation with a view to ensuring that the operating revenues make it possible to generate sufficient cash flow to recover investment costs, repay debts, cover operating, maintenance and necessary renewals expenses, and appropriately remunerate the capital employed.\nWe have considered two scenarios: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR, if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have also considered only one scenario based on market rentals.\nAs for the annual royalty fee (or concession fee or lease fee) paid by the private partner to the MITC as a percentage of the total revenue, we have assumed that it is equal to Zero.\nThis combination of different possibilities resulted in 6 possible scenarios for the PPP option, namely:\nScenario 0: DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation;\nScenario 1: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) without subsidy-VAT Excluded;\nScenario 2: DBFOT-Revised Design (8 floors) without subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 3: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included; and\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included-No corporate tax.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to two Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:\nPSC 1: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Initial Design (10 floors);\nPSC 2: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (8 floors).\nPSC 3: Public Sector Comparator 3 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (4 floors); and\nPSC 4: Public Sector Comparator 4 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (6 floors).\n\nSc. 0-DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation\nFor this scenario, there is no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost and the rental fees for the offices (per SQM).\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37 047 288 thousand (2022 terms).

The lettable space according to the different design scenarios is as follows:\nFor the base design with 10 floors: 9\xa0368 square metres\nFor the revised design with 8 floors: 7 348 square metres\nFor the revised design with 6 floors: 4 932 square metres\nFor the revised design with 4 floors: 3 321 square metres.\nCar Parking - The property will have 233\t car parking slots (for both the initial and revised design options), and these will be paid for separately by tenants in the building.\nRevenues/Rental Income\nThe revenue from the Property will be generated from two sources: letting out the office space and car parking slots. Rental charges for each of these areas has been assumed based the prevailing market rates in Lilongwe City Centre as follows:\nOffice Space will be charged at MK 26\xa0250 per square metre per month.\nCar Parking Slots will be charged at MK 61 250 per parking slot per month. City assemblies are currently charging MK 33 600 per month for parking slots along street roads.\nOccupancy Rate\nHigh end office buildings at City Centre in Lilongwe are currently commanding occupancy rates of between 80% and 95% based on information gathered from Knight Frank and Mpico, two of the largest property developers and managers in Lilongwe.\nAlthough an additional 50 000 square metres of office space is expected to enter the market in Lilongwe in the next 3 to 5 years, demand is expected to remain robust. Increase in demand for office space is expected to be driven by economic growth and the move by Lilongwe City Assembly to relocate all businesses from residential areas to designated business centres.\nThe Project Property has consequently assumed the following assumptions for office space and carparking area occupancy rates during the first three years and thereafter.\n\nAnnual revenues\nThe annual revenue for is presented in the following table.'

 ""Operating Costs\nNon-recoverable costs\nThese operating costs cover all the costs supported by the operator in running the Project during its operation period. They are not recoverable from tenants and thus they should feature among the OPEX.\nProperty Management Fees\nThe property will be managed by an established and professional firm with a good reputation both locally and internationally. This is key to ensure the property is able to attract and secure high-end and up-market tenants who are able to pay upper market rentals. A preliminary market sounding with property management companies in Malawi with high repute in the market has proven an interest from these firms to manage the Office Building. These companies charge management fees ranging from 5% to 10% of rental income. The Project has assumed Management Fees expenses at an average of 7.50% of gross rental income.\nProperty Insurance\nThe property will be comprehensively insured against all possible risks such as fire, storm damage, riot damage, earthquakes and forced breakages and other risks. Established general insurance firms like Nico General, United General Insurance and General Alliance premium rates for comprehensive cover average 0.25% of the property market value. The Project has assumed this premium rate in calculating insurance costs for the Property during the forecast period.\nFor Insurance purposes, we may consider two values for the building valuation: Replacement Value which is basically equal to the cost of re-constructing the building should it be completely or substantially destroyed and Market Valuation which is the price at which the building would trade between a willing buyer and a willing seller on arm’s length basis.\nMarket Valuation could be calculated by discounting future cash flows over the investment horizon, which has been assumed at 25 years in this case. The discount factor which has been derived from the expected real return on the investment has been estimated at 11.8%. This is calculated by subtracting the average inflation rate over the past 10 years (16.7% per annum) from the current long term bond yield (28.5% per annum). This approach is based on the fact that cash flow forecasts are in constant prices (not adjusting with inflation).\nFor Scenario 1 (initial design), the calculated Market Valuation of the building is MK 20,223,687,562, thus an annual property insurance cost of MK 50,559,219 for the first year of operation (2022 prices).\nMaintenance Costs\nSubstantive maintenance and repair costs such as periodic painting and water proofing, fixing broken plumbing or electrical faults and maintaining drainages, will be contracted out to service providers as and when required. As most maintenance and repair materials for high end office buildings are imported, the Project has assumed maintenance and repair costs based on South African standards where Malawi imports most of its requirements.\nBased on maintenance costs incurred by high end office development companies like Redefine Properties and Growth Point Properties, the Project has assumed property maintenance and repair costs at US$ 2.20 per square metre per annum.\nServices recoverable from tenants\nIn this section, we will enumerate the services whose costs are recoverable from the tenants, and thus not supported by the private partner. When these charges are levied, they do so proportionate to the percentage of rental space occupied.\nCity Rates and Ground Rent\nCity Rates will be payable to Lilongwe City Assembly and Ground Rent will be payable to Malawi Government in line with applicable city by-laws and schedule of charges. Lilongwe City Assembly currently charges City Rates at 0.50% of the property value payable every 6 months.\nLilongwe City Assembly has a formula for calculating the valuation of a building for city rates purposes. It is based on the Ground Coverage Area of the building and multiplies this by MK 350 000 to arrive at a figure which is then used for levying city rates. The MITC Building has a Ground Coverage Area of 1,228.37 square metres.\nGround Rent is charged at a fixed rate of MK 10 000 per year for the first year of operation (2022 prices), payable to Malawi Government.\nCleaning, Toiletries and Garbage Disposal Expenses\nCleaning services will be outsourced to a professional firm to be recommended by the property management company. Currently high-end buildings in Lilongwe like Kang'ombe Building, Reserve Bank, Standard Bank Centre et cetera have all outsourced these services. One of the reliable firms providing these services in Lilongwe is Transerve Logistics and they charge MK 175 per square metre of the gross floor area of the building being cleaned per month.\nLandscaping Services""

 'Recommendations\nAlthough suggesting several revised designs for the office building with less floors in the aim of reducing the investment costs, the project did not show major improvements in terms of investors’ profitability (Equity IRR) and project debt payment ability (Minimum ADSCR). With rental levels following the market rates, we conclude that a minimum public subsidy (around 60% for the different design scenarios) is necessary to guarantee the project feasibility through public-private partnership.\nBased on the specifics of the project and the results of the financial model, we recommend the implementation of the project according to the Scenario 7: DBFOT, Revised design (6 floors), with subsidy representing 40% of the CAPEX, VAT Included and with an exoneration of Corporate Tax, with a single contract signed between MITC and a private partner for a duration of 25 years.\nThis scenario results in the least budgetary impact for the public sector among the other scenarios, with a total public debt of MK 17\u202f302\u202f955 thousand at the end of the construction period, which will serve for the financing of the subsidy to the private sector entity (63.66% of the total investment cost at the end of the construction period). This scenario also presents a positive Value for Money for the public sector (25.6%) comparing to the public procurement option.\nDue to the relatively small size of the project and the features of such real-estate projects, it was recommended in the Needs and Options Analysis Report to consider the realization of the whole project through a single PPP contract (for one private contractor) with various aspects handled by sub-contractors.\nIt is recommended to move on, as soon as possible, to the procurement stage with a focus on the following steps:\nCarrying out a legal due diligence (during the preparation of the business consultation file) to optimize contractual arrangements with the private sector (operator/private operator).\nDeveloping a transaction plan based on the selected PPP model;\nStarting the preparation of the project PPP tender documents.\nUndertaking the project under a PPP model has several advantages compared to traditional public procurement, it allows to:\nReduce the overall cost (design, construction and operation) of the project; the comparison of the selected PPP option (Scenario 7) with the public procurement option shows that the PPP option is less expensive than the public procurement (Value for Money = MK 3 147 378 thousand);\nHave a single entity responsible for the design, construction and operation;\nMobilize private financing for the realization of works related to the construction of the MITC Office Building.\nMobilizing private financing through lenders requires structuring a bankable project. This is conditional on substantial support from the Public Sector in order to guarantee the mobilization of the financial resources necessary for the payment of rents.'

 'The legal, regulatory and policy framework for the project comprises the Republic of Malawi Constitution of 1994 as well as various legislations that cover public private partnerships, infrastructure development permits, real estate issues, foreign direct investments, controls on foreign exchange transactions, dividend repatriation and requirement for environmental and social impact assessments.\nThe legal framework for PPP in Malawi consists of the Public-Private Partnership Act (the “PPP Act”) No. 23 of 2022 which provides :\nfor partnerships between the public sector and private sector for the supply of infrastructure and delivery of services as means of contributing towards sustaining economic growth, social development and infrastructure development;\nfor the development and implementation of public private partnership arrangements in Malawi for the delivery of infrastructure and services; to provide for the establishment of the Public-Private Partnership Commission;\nfor privatisation of state owned enterprises, commercial entities and commercial assets; and\n to provide for matters connected with or incidental to the foregoing.\nThe PPP Act facilitate the development and implementation of public-private partnership arrangements for purposes of efficient delivery of infrastructure and services in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and social development, therefore it can be perfectly adapted to the Project. \nThe PPP Act No. 23 of 2022 enacted into law by Parliament on the 5th of April 2022 and is now operational. The overall objective of the new law is to promote expedited and efficient implementation of PPP arrangements. The PPP Law provides for the possibility to structure the Project through: \na Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) incorporated under the Companies Act specifically for this purpose or;\na Joint Venture agreement (JV) between the Contracting Authority and the private Partner, provided that the Joint Venture provisions may be incorporated into the public-private partnership agreement.\nThe shareholders of the Special Purpose Vehicle shall be the Minister responsible for Finance and the private Partner and the two must enter into a Shareholders agreement the terms of which must be as prescribed by the Minister.\nThe PPP framework in Malawi also compromises the Public-Private Partnership Policy Framework, approved by Cabinet on 18 May 2011, setting out the policy framework for initiating, designing and implementation of PPPs in Malawi.\nThe legal status of Malawi Investment and Trade Centre as a Contracting Party\nThe Malawi Investment and Trade Centre (MITC) is incorporated, under the Companies Act, as a company limited by shares since the 2 of December 2010. Directors of MITC are the Secretary of Industry and Trade, Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary for Public Sector Reforms Management. The shareholders of MITC are the Secretary of Industry and Trade and Secretary to the Treasury. MITC is a state-owned enterprise pursuant to the Companies Act No. 15 of 2013 and the Public Private Partnership Act No. 23 of 2022. Section 26 of the Companies Act provides that a company is classified as state owned if it is controlled by the Government and further, section 2 of the Public Private Partnership Act provides that a state-owned enterprise is a company in which the Government has a direct or indirect ownership and interest.  For the purposes of contracting under public-private partnership, section 2 of the PPP Act provides that a contracting authority shall include a state-owned enterprise and the state-owned enterprise shall have the power to enter into a PPP contract with private parties in accordance with 28(d) of the PPP Act. It is therefore concluded that MITC has the power to enter into a PPP Contract as a state-owned enterprise. The Directions of MITC will have the power to execute the contracts as provided for under section 74 of the Articles of Association Of MITC.\nOn a practical level, there is need for MITC to re-register the company in the current Malawi Business Registration System as directed by the Registrar of Companies so that Annual Returns and other compliance requirements are complied with.'
 'Results of the financial modelling of the different project delivery models\nThe financial modelling of a PPP project aims to test the bankability of the project, i.e., its ability to attract private financing with its two components: debt and equity. This financing resources could be completed by a possible contribution of the Public Sector in the investment cost financing through subsidies.\nAssumptions of the model\nThe following general assumptions were used in the model:\nDuration of the PPP contract: 25 years\nDuration of construction period: 2 years\nConstruction profile per year:\nAverage amortization period: 23 years.\nThe following financial structure assumptions were used in the model:\nEquity: 40% of total debt and equity\nDebt: 60% of total debt and equity\nDebt maturity: 23 years\nInterest rate (private sector): 18%\nInterest rate (public sector): 28%\nGrace period: 2 years\nReimbursement method: constant P+I (Principal + Debt).\nEquity is provided by private investors (also called shareholders) who are often promoters, operating companies as well as specialized investment funds seeking long-term profitability (e.g., pension funds). These equity capitals usually represent about 30% of private financing. In the event of early termination of the PPP contract, this equity is not recoverable. In this financial modelling, we take a percentage of 40% as input data.\nDebt is provided by commercial banks and lenders. Debt usually accounts for about 70% of private financing. In the event of early termination of the PPP contract, the principal of the debt is “reimbursed” to the banks by the Public Sector. In this financial modelling, we take a percentage of 60% as input data.\nThe investment grant may be necessary to supplement the private financing of the PPP project and achieve full financing of the investment cost. In this financial modelling, we calculate the subsidy as a percentage of the investment cost. We vary this percentage manually until we reach a sufficient level of profitability for the shareholders (the key measurement indicator is the IRR of the shareholders (equity IRR) which must be greater than 15%) while respecting a debt service coverage ratio (Average Debt Coverage Ratio or ADSCR of at least 1.2).\nThe maturity of the debt is the period after which the debt is completely repaid. This duration is 3 years less than the contract duration. This is a requirement made by the banks to have a margin of manoeuvre of 3 years in case of an event hindering the progress of the contract (delay during the construction period, force majeure event, etc.).\nThe grace period is the period during which the project company does not repay any debt annuity to the banks. It is fixed at 2 years to cover the construction period, which means that the first annuity is paid at the end of the first year of operation.\nThe chosen reimbursement method is constant P+I. The other possible modality is linear depreciation. For the P+I, P means the principal of the debt and I means the interest of the debt. Since this quantity is constant, it implies that the project company pays a lot of interest at the start (“little” principal) and little interest at the end of the contract (a “lot” of principal). The P+I method is often preferred by investors because it allows a constant annuity.\nThe other macroeconomic assumptions of the project are:\nAnnual inflation (during the project period): 15%;\nVAT Rate: 16.5%; and\nCorporate income rate: 30%.'
 'Title: Table 33 Uses and Sources at the end of the construction period – Scenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors)-with subsidy-VAT Included (Public Sector)\n\nSummary:\n- The table shows the uses and sources of funds at the end of the construction period for Scenario 5, which is a DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with a subsidy and VAT included for the Public Sector.\n- The main use of funds is subsidies to the private partner, which account for 81.9% of the total uses.\n- The main source of funds is debt, which accounts for 100% of the total sources.\n- The total uses and sources are equal, indicating that the project is financially viable.']","['The Public Sector can support the mobilization of private financing for a PPP project by providing a legal framework that encourages private investment, offering financial incentives to private investors, and providing technical assistance to private investors.']"
Explain how an increase in the operating costs by 10% during the project's lifetime affects the project's equilibrium and the Value for Money.,"An increase in the operating costs by 10% during the project's lifetime will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium (equity IRR= 13.95%) but will slightly enhance the Value for Money. However, the private debt is still paid with minimum ADSCR almost not affected (1.66). On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money. We conclude that the weight of the operating costs is negligeable comparing to the impact of the investment costs on the project parameters, which are considered very important and hard to cover through the operating revenues generated by the project.","['Sensitivity analysis\nA sensitivity analysis has been applied to the financial model for scenario 3 in order to assess its resilience to changes in assumptions and risk components over the Project term. Sensitivity tests were carried out by the Consultant on the main parameters taken individually in order to judge the financial robustness of the proposed financial package. For each sensitivity, these results make it possible to measure the impact of the deviation of a variable on the main model outputs, such the equity IRR, the minimum ADSCR, costs and revenues, public sector NPV and the Value for Money.\nThe sensitivity analysis allowed to obtain the following observations on the project resilience to changes:\nAn increase in the contract period to 30 years instead of 25 resulted in an improvement in the NPV of the public sector. However, the Value for Money (VfM) becomes negative at -12.5% as the private sector’s NPV is almost unchanged. The equity IRR increased by almost 1% at 15.31%. The project IRR doubles at 2.41% and the minimum ADSCR remains almost stable. \nIf the construction period increases by 1 year, this will cause an amelioration of the NPV of the public sector as the grants are paid later, the Value for Money becomes negative at 21.1% and the project and equity IRR deteriorate at respectively 0.66% and 12.76%.\nAn increase in the construction costs by 10% will deteriorate the profitability of the project at 12.45%. The Value for Money slightly enhances at 20.4%.\nWhen the public subsidy increases by 15% of the construction costs, the equity IRR and the minimum ADSCR will jump respectively to 26.79% and 2.72. As for the public sector, this will result in a negative value for money at -3.7%.\nThe increase in the inflation rate by 5 points (20%) improved the Equity IRR (15.96%) and the minimum ADSCR (1.81) for the project company, and its operation revenue NPV will more than double. This has an adverse effect on the Value for Money that decreased at 6.7%. On the contrary, a decrease in the inflation rate by 5 points (10%) will not profit the project company nor the public sector but will enhance the Value for Money at 23.9%.\nIf the project experiences an increase in the operating costs by 10% during its whole life, this will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium (equity IRR= 13.95%) but will slightly enhance the Value for Money. However, the private debt is still paid with minimum ADSCR almost not affected (1.66). On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money. We conclude that the weight of the operating costs is negligeable comparing to the impact of the investment costs on the project parameters, which are considered very important and hard to cover through the operating revenues generated by the project.\nFinally, a further increase in the rental fees by 10% will improve the project and the equity IRRs (2.09% and 16.81% respectively) and will result in a decrease in the VfM for the public sector (circa 11.8%). This should be carefully considered as higher rental fees could induce an escape rate from the users. However, a decrease by 10% in the rental fees will result in lower equity IRR and minimum ADSCR (11.97% and 1.51 respectively). The VfM is positively affected in this scenario, which confirms that high-rental fees should be maintained to ensure the project feasibility through PPP. The private partner should make a high marketing effort to maintain the forecasted occupancy rate at its highest level.

 'The sensitivity analysis allowed to obtain the following observations on the project resilience to changes:\nAn increase in the contract period to 30 years instead of 25 resulted in an improvement in the NPV of the public sector. However, the Value for Money (VfM) becomes negative at -12.5% as the private sector’s NPV is almost unchanged. The equity IRR increase by almost 1% at 15.31%. The project IRR doubles at 2.41% and the minimum ADSCR remains almost stable. \nIf the construction period increases by 1 year, this will cause an amelioration of the NPV of the public sector as the grants are paid later, the Value for Money becomes negative at 21.1% and the project and equity IRR deteriorate at respectively 0.66% and 12.76%.\nAn increase in the construction costs by 10% will deteriorate the profitability of the project at 12.45%. The Value for Money slightly enhances at 20.4%.\nWhen the public subsidy increases by 15% of the construction costs, the equity IRR and the minimum ADSCR will jump respectively to 26.79% and 2.72. As for the public sector, this will result in a negative value for money at -3.7%.\nThe increase in the inflation rate by 5 points (20%) improved the Equity IRR (15.96%) and the minimum ADSCR (1.81) for the project company, and its operation revenue NPV will more than double. This is has an adverse effect on the Value for Money that decreased at 6.7%. On the contrary, a decrease in the inflation rate by 5 points (10%) will not profit the project company nor the public sector but will enhance the Value for Money at 23.9%.\nIf the project experiences an increase in the operating costs by 10% during its whole life, this will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium (equity IRR= 13.95%) but will slightly enhance the Value for Money. However, the private debt is still paid with minimum ADSCR almost not affected (1.66). On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money. We conclude that the weight of the operating costs is negligeable comparing to the impact of the investment costs on the project parameters, which are considered very important and hard to cover through the operating revenues generated by the project.\nFinally, a further increase in the rental fees by 10% will improve the project and the equity IRRs (2.09% and 16.81% respectively) and will result in a decrease in the VfM for the public sector (circa 11.8%). This should be carefully considered as higher rental fees could induce an escape rate from the users. However, a decrease by 10% in the rental fees will result in lower equity IRR and minimum ADSCR (11.97% and 1.51 respectively). The VfM is positively affected in this scenario, which confirms that a high-rental fees should be maintained to ensure the project feasibility through PPP. The private partner should make a high marketing effort to maintain the forecasted occupancy rate at its highest level. He should also ensure hight standards for the building to attract tenants and keep them in the long term, and this should be embedded in the evaluation criteria.\nConclusion and recommendations\nAlthough suggesting several revised designs for the office building with less floors in the aim of reducing the investment costs, the project did not show major improvements in terms of investors’ profitability (Equity IRR) and project debt payment ability (Minimum ADSCR). With rental levels following the market rates, we conclude that a minimum public subsidy (around 60% for the different design scenarios) is necessary to guarantee the project feasibility through public-private partnership.\nBased on the specifics of the project and the results of the financial model, we recommend the implementation of the project according to the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax with a single contract signed between MITC and a private partner for a duration of 25 years.\nThis scenario results in the least budgetary impact for the public sector among the other scenarios, with a total public debt of MK 13 697 955 thousand at the end of the construction period serving for the financing of the subsidy to the private sector entity (40% of the total investment cost at the end of the construction period). This scenario also presents a positive Value for Money for the public sector (17.4%) comparing to the public procurement option.\nDue to the relatively small size of the project and the features of such real-estate projects, it was recommended in the Needs and Options Analysis Report to consider the realization of the whole project through a single PPP contract (for one private contractor) with various aspects handled by sub-contractors.\nIt is recommended to move on, as soon as possible, to the procurement stage with a focus on the following steps:'
 ""Title: Table 10 Cost of the project for the State in the public procurement model - risk-adjusted- Sc. 6: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included\n\nSummary:\n- The table compares the Net Present Value (NPV) and Value for Money (VfM) of the public sector comparator and Sc.6-DBFOT-6 floors-with subs.-VAT Inc. scenario.\n- The NPV for the public sector with risks is -18,090,964 '000 MK, while the NPV for Sc.6 is -12,454,248 '000 MK.\n- The VfM for Sc.6 is 5,636,716 '000 MK, which represents a 31.2% improvement compared to the public sector comparator.\n- The main difference between the two scenarios is the inclusion of a subsidy in Sc.6, which reduces the PV of debt service and increases the VfM.""
 ""Value for Money Assessment\nIntroduction\nThe Value for Money (hereafter “VfM”) analysis consists of carrying out an assessment of the overall cost of the project, taking into account the value of the inherent risks, depending on whether the project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP.\nThe analysis and comparison of the financial profitability of different options is ultimately measured by means of the VfM. In order to assess the VfM of each option, we use the results of the financial model which adopts the point of view of the MITC and the private partner by estimating the overall cost of the project for the public sector of each option over the project duration.\nThis cost is then risk-adjusted, i.e., the cost of risks borne by the public sector (and which have not been transferred to the private partner) is added. The cost of risks is provided by the risk register, the results of which are in Appendix 3 section.\nBest practice in financial analysis and modelling requires that a set of different options and sensitivities be evaluated and compared.\nThe Value for Money is a percentage which indicates in absolute terms the increase in value offered by the PPP option compared to the public procurement option, i.e., an option where the project is carried out with one or more traditional procurement models.\nThe Value for Money for the PPP option is achieved through the commitment of efficiency, effectiveness and savings that can be achieved by the private sector and the appropriate allocation of risk in the project. Factors that determine whether the VfM of a PPP option is positive include:\nA better distribution of risks which are allocated to the counterparty that is the best to manage it;\nLong-term contract: predictability of costs and revenues for counterparties;\nCall for tenders implemented quickly;\nImproved quality of service;\nCompensation structure based on performance incentives; and\nReduction of costs over the life cycle of the project thanks to an optimization of the maintenance of the infrastructures.\nQuantitative assessment\nIn order to quantitatively assess the VfM, the financial model estimates the cost to the public authority for each option. The project costs, which are borne by the project company during the term of the contract, are risk-adjusted and then compared in terms of NPV to the costs of the risk-adjusted Public Sector Comparator. In the following section, we present the results of this analysis. The different total costs of the project for the Public Sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down below. We remind that the Value for Money only makes sense for PPP scenario that are bankable (Debt is paid with DSCR >1.2) and attractive to investors (Equity IRR > 15%).\nValue for Money for the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included)\nFor the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design 10 floors-with subsidy-VAT Included, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is PSC 1, the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\n\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 4 048 699    thousand) for Sc.3-DBFOT-Init. Design-with subs.-VAT Inc., this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the estimated value of the risks retained by the public authority, which is lower for the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator (where the public authority bears all the risks of the project). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the Public Sector by 11.9% for Sc. 3: DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included.\nThe private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues cover operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, equity, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and expenses are investment costs (CAPEX) and capitalized interest.\nThe revenues of the Public Sector in the PPP options are mainly taxes generated from the operation of the project.\nValue for Money for the Scenario 4 (DBFOT-Revised design 4 floors-with subs.-VAT Inc.)\nFor the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:""
 'Title: Table 42 Cost of the project for the Public Sector in the public procurement model - risk-adjusted - Sc. 3: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors)-with subsidy-VAT Included\n\nSummary:\n\n- The table compares the costs of the project for the public sector in the public procurement model under scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design with subsidy and VAT included) with the public sector comparator.\n\n- The NPV for the public sector with risks is lower in scenario 3 (-30,116,880) compared to the public sector comparator (-34,165,578).\n\n- The value for money (VfM) is positive in scenario 3 (4,048,699), indicating that the project is economically viable.\n\n- The VfM as a percentage of the public sector NPV with risks is 11.9%, which is a significant improvement compared to the public sector comparator.\n\n- The main differences in costs between scenario 3 and the public sector comparator are:\n\n - PV of VAT: Scenario 3 includes VAT, while the public sector comparator does not.\n - PV of Taxes: Scenario 3 includes taxes, while the public sector comparator does not.\n - PV of O&M Costs: Scenario 3 does not include O&M costs, while the public sector comparator does.\n - PV of Operation revenues: Scenario 3 includes negative operation revenues, while the public sector comparator includes positive operation revenues.']","[""An increase in operating costs by 10% during the project's lifetime will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium, with an equity IRR of 13.95%.

On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money.""]"
What is the range of management fees charged by property management companies in Malawi?,"The provided text indicates that management fees charged by property management companies in Malawi range from 5% to 10% of rental income, with the project assuming an average of 7.50% of gross rental income.","['Title: Table 15 Summary of the project construction costs according to the different design scenarios\n\n- The table provides a summary of the project construction costs according to different design scenarios, ranging from an initial design with 10 floors to a revised design with 4 floors.\n\n- The costs are categorized into various items, including the Main Office Block Building, Prime Cost & Provisional Sums, All External Works, MRA VAT on Construction Costs, NCIC Levy on Construction Costs, Lilongwe City Council Scrutiny Fees, Sub-Total, Professional Fees, MRA VAT on Fees, NCIC Levy on Fees, and TOTAL ESTIMATE IN MALAWI KWACHA (MK).\n\n- The total estimated cost in Malawi Kwacha (MK) varies across the design scenarios, with the initial design with 10 floors having the highest cost at 37,047,288,000 MK and the revised design with 4 floors having the lowest cost at 15,156,985,460 MK.\n\n- The total estimated cost in US Dollars (US$) also varies, with the initial design with 10 floors having the highest cost at 36,003,195 US$ and the revised design with 4 floors having the lowest cost at 14,729,821 US$.\n\n- The costs for each item vary depending on the design scenario, with the Main Office Block Building and Professional Fees being the most significant cost components.'
 ""Operating Costs\nNon-recoverable costs\nThese operating costs cover all the costs supported by the operator in running the Project during its operation period. They are not recoverable from tenants and thus they should feature among the OPEX.\nProperty Management Fees\nThe property will be managed by an established and professional firm with a good reputation both locally and internationally. This is key to ensure the property is able to attract and secure high-end and up-market tenants who are able to pay upper market rentals. A preliminary market sounding with property management companies in Malawi with high repute in the market has proven an interest from these firms to manage the Office Building. These companies charge management fees ranging from 5% to 10% of rental income. The Project has assumed Management Fees expenses at an average of 7.50% of gross rental income.\nProperty Insurance\nThe property will be comprehensively insured against all possible risks such as fire, storm damage, riot damage, earthquakes and forced breakages and other risks. Established general insurance firms like Nico General, United General Insurance and General Alliance premium rates for comprehensive cover average 0.25% of the property market value. The Project has assumed this premium rate in calculating insurance costs for the Property during the forecast period.\nFor Insurance purposes, we may consider two values for the building valuation: Replacement Value which is basically equal to the cost of re-constructing the building should it be completely or substantially destroyed and Market Valuation which is the price at which the building would trade between a willing buyer and a willing seller on arm’s length basis.\nMarket Valuation could be calculated by discounting future cash flows over the investment horizon, which has been assumed at 25 years in this case. The discount factor which has been derived from the expected real return on the investment has been estimated at 11.8%. This is calculated by subtracting the average inflation rate over the past 10 years (16.7% per annum) from the current long term bond yield (28.5% per annum). This approach is based on the fact that cash flow forecasts are in constant prices (not adjusting with inflation).\nFor Scenario 1 (initial design), the calculated Market Valuation of the building is MK 20,223,687,562, thus an annual property insurance cost of MK 50,559,219 for the first year of operation (2022 prices).\nMaintenance Costs\nSubstantive maintenance and repair costs such as periodic painting and water proofing, fixing broken plumbing or electrical faults and maintaining drainages, will be contracted out to service providers as and when required. As most maintenance and repair materials for high end office buildings are imported, the Project has assumed maintenance and repair costs based on South African standards where Malawi imports most of its requirements.\nBased on maintenance costs incurred by high end office development companies like Redefine Properties and Growth Point Properties, the Project has assumed property maintenance and repair costs at US$ 2.20 per square metre per annum.\nServices recoverable from tenants\nIn this section, we will enumerate the services whose costs are recoverable from the tenants, and thus not supported by the private partner. When these charges are levied, they do so proportionate to the percentage of rental space occupied.\nCity Rates and Ground Rent\nCity Rates will be payable to Lilongwe City Assembly and Ground Rent will be payable to Malawi Government in line with applicable city by-laws and schedule of charges. Lilongwe City Assembly currently charges City Rates at 0.50% of the property value payable every 6 months.\nLilongwe City Assembly has a formula for calculating the valuation of a building for city rates purposes. It is based on the Ground Coverage Area of the building and multiplies this by MK 350 000 to arrive at a figure which is then used for levying city rates. The MITC Building has a Ground Coverage Area of 1,228.37 square metres.\nGround Rent is charged at a fixed rate of MK 10 000 per year for the first year of operation (2022 prices), payable to Malawi Government.\nCleaning, Toiletries and Garbage Disposal Expenses\nCleaning services will be outsourced to a professional firm to be recommended by the property management company. Currently high-end buildings in Lilongwe like Kang'ombe Building, Reserve Bank, Standard Bank Centre et cetera have all outsourced these services. One of the reliable firms providing these services in Lilongwe is Transerve Logistics and they charge MK 175 per square metre of the gross floor area of the building being cleaned per month.\nLandscaping Services""

 'Life cycle cost calculations are based on estimated cash-flows, discount rates and time horizons. Clearly these estimates cannot be known with certainty and hence risk is present.

City assemblies are currently charging MK 33 600 per month for parking slots along street roads.\nThe second is based on a higher revenue scenario, resulting in higher rental charges as follows:\nOffice Space will be charged at MK 59\xa0278 per square metre per month.\nCar Parking Slots will be charged at MK 61 250 per parking slot per month.\nThis second scenario has been considered for the aim of increasing the profitability and the bankability of the project, which suffers from high and disproportionate development costs and debt service in comparison with the annual revenues generated from the operation of the building. However, this scenario has been rejected by the procurement authority, leaving only a scenario based on market rental fees.\nWe have assumed the following occupancy rates for office space and carparking area during the first three years and thereafter:\n\n\nThe annual revenue for a market-rate profile is presented in the following table.\n\nThe summary of the non-recoverable OPEX assumptions for a market-rate scenario (2022 prices) be supported by the private partner is presented in the following table.\n\nThe retained financial and macro-economic parameters for the project period are as follows:\nAnnual inflation: 15%;\n10-Year Bond/Treasury Note Yield: 28.50% per year;\nInterest Rate: 17.30% per year;\nReference exchange rate for cost calculations: 1029 MK/ $ (November 2022);\nAnnual depreciation rate of the value of the Kwacha: 10.6% (in converting all foreign currency capital and operating expenditure items);\nAnnual GDP growth: 4.0% during the project forecast period;\nAnnual population growth rate: 2.80% during the forecast period\nVAT Rate: 16.5%\nCorporate income rate: 30%.'

The lettable space according to the different design scenarios is as follows:\nFor the base design with 10 floors: 9\xa0368 square metres\nFor the revised design with 8 floors: 7 348 square metres\nFor the revised design with 6 floors: 4 932 square metres\nFor the revised design with 4 floors: 3 321 square metres.\nCar Parking - The property will have 233\t car parking slots (for both the initial and revised design options), and these will be paid for separately by tenants in the building.\nRevenues/Rental Income\nThe revenue from the Property will be generated from two sources: letting out the office space and car parking slots. Rental charges for each of these areas has been assumed based the prevailing market rates in Lilongwe City Centre as follows:\nOffice Space will be charged at MK 26\xa0250 per square metre per month.\nCar Parking Slots will be charged at MK 61 250 per parking slot per month. City assemblies are currently charging MK 33 600 per month for parking slots along street roads.\nOccupancy Rate\nHigh end office buildings at City Centre in Lilongwe are currently commanding occupancy rates of between 80% and 95% based on information gathered from Knight Frank and Mpico, two of the largest property developers and managers in Lilongwe.\nAlthough an additional 50 000 square metres of office space is expected to enter the market in Lilongwe in the next 3 to 5 years, demand is expected to remain robust. Increase in demand for office space is expected to be driven by economic growth and the move by Lilongwe City Assembly to relocate all businesses from residential areas to designated business centres.\nThe Project Property has consequently assumed the following assumptions for office space and carparking area occupancy rates during the first three years and thereafter.\n\nAnnual revenues\nThe annual revenue for is presented in the following table.'

What is the net present value (NPV) for the public sector with risks in Table 45?,"The provided context does not contain Table 45, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.","[""Value for Money Assessment\nIntroduction\nThe Value for Money (hereafter “VfM”) analysis consists of carrying out an assessment of the overall cost of the project, taking into account the value of the inherent risks, depending on whether the project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP.\nThe analysis and comparison of the financial profitability of different options is ultimately measured by means of the VfM. In order to assess the VfM of each option, we use the results of the financial model which adopts the point of view of the MITC and the private partner by estimating the overall cost of the project for the public sector of each option over the project duration.\nThis cost is then risk-adjusted, i.e., the cost of risks borne by the public sector (and which have not been transferred to the private partner) is added. The cost of risks is provided by the risk register, the results of which are in Appendix 3 section.\nBest practice in financial analysis and modelling requires that a set of different options and sensitivities be evaluated and compared.\nThe Value for Money is a percentage which indicates in absolute terms the increase in value offered by the PPP option compared to the public procurement option, i.e., an option where the project is carried out with one or more traditional procurement models.\nThe Value for Money for the PPP option is achieved through the commitment of efficiency, effectiveness and savings that can be achieved by the private sector and the appropriate allocation of risk in the project. Factors that determine whether the VfM of a PPP option is positive include:\nA better distribution of risks which are allocated to the counterparty that is the best to manage it;\nLong-term contract: predictability of costs and revenues for counterparties;\nCall for tenders implemented quickly;\nImproved quality of service;\nCompensation structure based on performance incentives; and\nReduction of costs over the life cycle of the project thanks to an optimization of the maintenance of the infrastructures.\nQuantitative assessment\nIn order to quantitatively assess the VfM, the financial model estimates the cost to the public authority for each option. The project costs, which are borne by the project company during the term of the contract, are risk-adjusted and then compared in terms of NPV to the costs of the risk-adjusted Public Sector Comparator. In the following section, we present the results of this analysis. The different total costs of the project for the Public Sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down below. We remind that the Value for Money only makes sense for PPP scenario that are bankable (Debt is paid with DSCR >1.2) and attractive to investors (Equity IRR > 15%).\nValue for Money for the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included)\nFor the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design 10 floors-with subsidy-VAT Included, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is PSC 1, the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\n\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 4 048 699    thousand) for Sc.3-DBFOT-Init. Design-with subs.-VAT Inc., this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the estimated value of the risks retained by the public authority, which is lower for the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator (where the public authority bears all the risks of the project). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the Public Sector by 11.9% for Sc. 3: DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included.\nThe private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals.

 'Risk Analysis\nRisk analysis focuses on the probability that events do not occur as planned and measurement of the consequences of such failure. The methodology followed during risk analysis includes risk identification, quantification and allocation during the Feasibility Study, Pre-procurement and Procurement and Evaluation stages of the Project.\nFor the project consisting of designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining the MITC office complex, the risks can be classified into two main categories:\nGeneral risks or country risks which are linked to the political, economic and legal environment of the country and over which the two partners have no control; and\nProject-specific risks over which the public and the private partners may have some control.\nThe table below summarizes the main risks of the project.\nThe Risk Matrix includes the key risks that may impact the project as well as the adopted approach of managing and mitigating these risks in similar projects undertaken in the region and internationally.\nRisk is quantified by measuring the potential to incur (additional) costs above baseline costs.\nThe first step is to determine the cost to the State of each identified risk, depending on whether the Project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP. This cost is calculated as follows:\n\nWhere:\n= Probability of occurrence of risk n\n= Reference value or base cost defined for risk n – established for each risk according to its nature\n= Share of the risk borne by the public sector or the cost of the impact – varies according to the option considered (Public Sector Comparator or PPP).\nThe risks are classified according to the stages of the project in which they occur, namely:\nPlanning\nProcurement\nDesign\nConstruction\nOperating period which includes both operation and maintenance of the infrastructure\nRenewal and transfer (handover) period that takes into account life cycle expenses and handover of infrastructure at contract expiration.\nRisks at each of the above project stages will be subdivided into the following sub-categories:\nTechnical – covering aspects such as asset efficiency, durability and achievement of specifications\nLegal - covering aspects related to changes in laws or compliance with existing laws and regulations\nCommercial - covering aspects related to input prices, general availability of inputs as well as insurability of risks\nFinancial/monetary – covering aspects related to the impact of changes in key financial variables such as inflation, interest rate and exchange rate, public financing shortfall, private financing shortfall, debt default, remuneration\nPolitical/social - covering aspects related to social unrest, civil unrest, industrial strikes, terrorism, etc.\nEnvironmental - covering aspects related to the environmental issues that could be faced by the project.\nAs for the probability of occurrence and the rank, it is the probability that a risk occurs and is described as a percentage and a descriptive rank.\nThe financial impact of a risk (share of the risk borne by the public sector) is assessed according to three scenarios: Maximum, Medium and Minimum impact scenario, reflecting cost impact as a result of the risk occurrence.\n\nCost, revenue and economic assumptions\nBesides the initial design, three additional design scenarios have been requested by the MITC for the office complex.\nAccording to the initial base design, the building will be built on 11 floors, as well as a basement (~3 690 m2) and a ground floor (~1’228 m2). The area of the total building is estimated at 16 365 square meters, of which 9 940 square meters are allocated to lettable and the MITC useable areas. The overall construction cost for this scenario is estimated at MK 37 047 288\xa0000, which is equivalent to US$ 36 003 195 in November 2022 exchange rates.\nThe following table summarises the features and costs of the three additional design propositions.'

How does an increase in the construction costs by 10% impact the project's profitability?,An increase in the construction costs by 10% will deteriorate the profitability of the project at 12.45%.,"['Sensitivity analysis\nA sensitivity analysis has been applied to the financial model for scenario 3 in order to assess its resilience to changes in assumptions and risk components over the Project term. Sensitivity tests were carried out by the Consultant on the main parameters taken individually in order to judge the financial robustness of the proposed financial package. For each sensitivity, these results make it possible to measure the impact of the deviation of a variable on the main model outputs, such the equity IRR, the minimum ADSCR, costs and revenues, public sector NPV and the Value for Money.\nThe sensitivity analysis allowed to obtain the following observations on the project resilience to changes:\nAn increase in the contract period to 30 years instead of 25 resulted in an improvement in the NPV of the public sector. However, the Value for Money (VfM) becomes negative at -12.5% as the private sector’s NPV is almost unchanged. The equity IRR increased by almost 1% at 15.31%. The project IRR doubles at 2.41% and the minimum ADSCR remains almost stable. \nIf the construction period increases by 1 year, this will cause an amelioration of the NPV of the public sector as the grants are paid later, the Value for Money becomes negative at 21.1% and the project and equity IRR deteriorate at respectively 0.66% and 12.76%.\nAn increase in the construction costs by 10% will deteriorate the profitability of the project at 12.45%. The Value for Money slightly enhances at 20.4%.\nWhen the public subsidy increases by 15% of the construction costs, the equity IRR and the minimum ADSCR will jump respectively to 26.79% and 2.72. As for the public sector, this will result in a negative value for money at -3.7%.\nThe increase in the inflation rate by 5 points (20%) improved the Equity IRR (15.96%) and the minimum ADSCR (1.81) for the project company, and its operation revenue NPV will more than double. This has an adverse effect on the Value for Money that decreased at 6.7%. On the contrary, a decrease in the inflation rate by 5 points (10%) will not profit the project company nor the public sector but will enhance the Value for Money at 23.9%.\nIf the project experiences an increase in the operating costs by 10% during its whole life, this will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium (equity IRR= 13.95%) but will slightly enhance the Value for Money. However, the private debt is still paid with minimum ADSCR almost not affected (1.66). On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money. We conclude that the weight of the operating costs is negligeable comparing to the impact of the investment costs on the project parameters, which are considered very important and hard to cover through the operating revenues generated by the project.\nFinally, a further increase in the rental fees by 10% will improve the project and the equity IRRs (2.09% and 16.81% respectively) and will result in a decrease in the VfM for the public sector (circa 11.8%). This should be carefully considered as higher rental fees could induce an escape rate from the users. However, a decrease by 10% in the rental fees will result in lower equity IRR and minimum ADSCR (11.97% and 1.51 respectively). The VfM is positively affected in this scenario, which confirms that high-rental fees should be maintained to ensure the project feasibility through PPP. The private partner should make a high marketing effort to maintain the forecasted occupancy rate at its highest level. He should also ensure high standards for the building to attract tenants and keep them in the long term, and this should be embedded in the evaluation criteria.'

As for the public sector, this will result in a negative value for money at -3.7%.\nThe increase in the inflation rate by 5 points (20%) improved the Equity IRR (15.96%) and the minimum ADSCR (1.81) for the project company, and its operation revenue NPV will more than double. This is has an adverse effect on the Value for Money that decreased at 6.7%. On the contrary, a decrease in the inflation rate by 5 points (10%) will not profit the project company nor the public sector but will enhance the Value for Money at 23.9%.\nIf the project experiences an increase in the operating costs by 10% during its whole life, this will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium (equity IRR= 13.95%) but will slightly enhance the Value for Money. However, the private debt is still paid with minimum ADSCR almost not affected (1.66). On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money. We conclude that the weight of the operating costs is negligeable comparing to the impact of the investment costs on the project parameters, which are considered very important and hard to cover through the operating revenues generated by the project.\nFinally, a further increase in the rental fees by 10% will improve the project and the equity IRRs (2.09% and 16.81% respectively) and will result in a decrease in the VfM for the public sector (circa 11.8%). This should be carefully considered as higher rental fees could induce an escape rate from the users. However, a decrease by 10% in the rental fees will result in lower equity IRR and minimum ADSCR (11.97% and 1.51 respectively). The VfM is positively affected in this scenario, which confirms that a high-rental fees should be maintained to ensure the project feasibility through PPP. The private partner should make a high marketing effort to maintain the forecasted occupancy rate at its highest level. He should also ensure hight standards for the building to attract tenants and keep them in the long term, and this should be embedded in the evaluation criteria.\nConclusion and recommendations\nAlthough suggesting several revised designs for the office building with less floors in the aim of reducing the investment costs, the project did not show major improvements in terms of investors’ profitability (Equity IRR) and project debt payment ability (Minimum ADSCR). With rental levels following the market rates, we conclude that a minimum public subsidy (around 60% for the different design scenarios) is necessary to guarantee the project feasibility through public-private partnership.\nBased on the specifics of the project and the results of the financial model, we recommend the implementation of the project according to the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax with a single contract signed between MITC and a private partner for a duration of 25 years.\nThis scenario results in the least budgetary impact for the public sector among the other scenarios, with a total public debt of MK 13 697 955 thousand at the end of the construction period serving for the financing of the subsidy to the private sector entity (40% of the total investment cost at the end of the construction period). This scenario also presents a positive Value for Money for the public sector (17.4%) comparing to the public procurement option.\nDue to the relatively small size of the project and the features of such real-estate projects, it was recommended in the Needs and Options Analysis Report to consider the realization of the whole project through a single PPP contract (for one private contractor) with various aspects handled by sub-contractors.\nIt is recommended to move on, as soon as possible, to the procurement stage with a focus on the following steps:'

The lettable space according to the different design scenarios is as follows:\nFor the base design with 10 floors: 9\xa0368 square metres\nFor the revised design with 8 floors: 7 348 square metres\nFor the revised design with 6 floors: 4 932 square metres\nFor the revised design with 4 floors: 3 321 square metres.\nCar Parking - The property will have 233\t car parking slots (for both the initial and revised design options), and these will be paid for separately by tenants in the building.\nRevenues/Rental Income\nThe revenue from the Property will be generated from two sources: letting out the office space and car parking slots. Rental charges for each of these areas has been assumed based the prevailing market rates in Lilongwe City Centre as follows:\nOffice Space will be charged at MK 26\xa0250 per square metre per month.\nCar Parking Slots will be charged at MK 61 250 per parking slot per month. City assemblies are currently charging MK 33 600 per month for parking slots along street roads.\nOccupancy Rate\nHigh end office buildings at City Centre in Lilongwe are currently commanding occupancy rates of between 80% and 95% based on information gathered from Knight Frank and Mpico, two of the largest property developers and managers in Lilongwe.\nAlthough an additional 50 000 square metres of office space is expected to enter the market in Lilongwe in the next 3 to 5 years, demand is expected to remain robust. Increase in demand for office space is expected to be driven by economic growth and the move by Lilongwe City Assembly to relocate all businesses from residential areas to designated business centres.\nThe Project Property has consequently assumed the following assumptions for office space and carparking area occupancy rates during the first three years and thereafter.\n\nAnnual revenues\nThe annual revenue for is presented in the following table.'

 'Selected scenarios\nSeveral cases of calculation could be envisaged in order to verify the criteria for evaluating the financial profitability of the project by varying the rents/revenue and/or the level of subsidy paid by the Public Sector to the private partner.\nIt should be noted that the definition of the subsidy rate on a new infrastructure implemented through PPP should result from a financial calculation with a view to ensuring that the operating revenues make it possible to generate sufficient cash flow to recover investment costs, repay debts, cover operating, maintenance and necessary renewals expenses, and appropriately remunerate the capital employed.\nWe have considered two scenarios: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR, if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have also considered only one scenario based on market rentals.\nAs for the annual royalty fee (or concession fee or lease fee) paid by the private partner to the MITC as a percentage of the total revenue, we have assumed that it is equal to Zero.\nThis combination of different possibilities resulted in 6 possible scenarios for the PPP option, namely:\nScenario 0: DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation;\nScenario 1: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) without subsidy-VAT Excluded;\nScenario 2: DBFOT-Revised Design (8 floors) without subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 3: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included; and\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included-No corporate tax.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to two Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:\nPSC 1: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Initial Design (10 floors);\nPSC 2: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (8 floors).\nPSC 3: Public Sector Comparator 3 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (4 floors); and\nPSC 4: Public Sector Comparator 4 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (6 floors).\n\nSc. 0-DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation\nFor this scenario, there is no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost and the rental fees for the offices (per SQM).\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37 047 288 thousand (2022 terms). By applying inflation during the construction period (12% during the construction period), we obtain the amount of MK 49,260,445 thousand.\nThe financing of the cost of construction is done partly by private debt which generates capitalised interests of MK 4,866,530 thousand. The total cost of the project at the end of the construction period stands at MK 54,126,975 thousand.\nThis amount is financed by debt up to MK 34,422,797 thousand, equity up to MK 19,704,178 thousand and with no subsidy.\n\nThe revenue curve corresponds to the revenue generated by the project, i.e., rental income from office space and car slots. In this case, the private partner is remunerated directly by the tenants.\n\nThe revenues of the public sector come from taxes collected (VAT, income tax, etc.), from which is deducted the amount of rental paid by the MITC to the private partner for its allocated space.\nThis scenario presents a low equity IRR (1.26%) and a low ADSCR (0.67), which means that implementing the project through this format does not attract private investors and does not allow to pay the annual debt service. For these reasons, this scenario has been eliminated from the financial modelling of the Value for Money.\nSc. 1-DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Exclusive\nFor this scenario, there is also no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost and the rental fees for the offices (per SQM).\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37,047,288 thousand (2022 terms).

 ""Value for Money Assessment\nIntroduction\nThe Value for Money (hereafter “VfM”) analysis consists of carrying out an assessment of the overall cost of the project, taking into account the value of the inherent risks, depending on whether the project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP.\nThe analysis and comparison of the financial profitability of different options is ultimately measured by means of the VfM. In order to assess the VfM of each option, we use the results of the financial model which adopts the point of view of the MITC and the private partner by estimating the overall cost of the project for the public sector of each option over the project duration.\nThis cost is then risk-adjusted, i.e., the cost of risks borne by the public sector (and which have not been transferred to the private partner) is added. The cost of risks is provided by the risk register, the results of which are in Appendix 3 section.\nBest practice in financial analysis and modelling requires that a set of different options and sensitivities be evaluated and compared.\nThe Value for Money is a percentage which indicates in absolute terms the increase in value offered by the PPP option compared to the public procurement option, i.e., an option where the project is carried out with one or more traditional procurement models.\nThe Value for Money for the PPP option is achieved through the commitment of efficiency, effectiveness and savings that can be achieved by the private sector and the appropriate allocation of risk in the project. Factors that determine whether the VfM of a PPP option is positive include:\nA better distribution of risks which are allocated to the counterparty that is the best to manage it;\nLong-term contract: predictability of costs and revenues for counterparties;\nCall for tenders implemented quickly;\nImproved quality of service;\nCompensation structure based on performance incentives; and\nReduction of costs over the life cycle of the project thanks to an optimization of the maintenance of the infrastructures.\nQuantitative assessment\nIn order to quantitatively assess the VfM, the financial model estimates the cost to the public authority for each option. The project costs, which are borne by the project company during the term of the contract, are risk-adjusted and then compared in terms of NPV to the costs of the risk-adjusted Public Sector Comparator. In the following section, we present the results of this analysis. The different total costs of the project for the Public Sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down below. We remind that the Value for Money only makes sense for PPP scenario that are bankable (Debt is paid with DSCR >1.2) and attractive to investors (Equity IRR > 15%).\nValue for Money for the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included)\nFor the Scenario 3 (DBFOT-Initial Design 10 floors-with subsidy-VAT Included, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is PSC 1, the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\n\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 4 048 699    thousand) for Sc.3-DBFOT-Init. Design-with subs.-VAT Inc., this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the estimated value of the risks retained by the public authority, which is lower for the PPP option compared to the Public Sector Comparator (where the public authority bears all the risks of the project). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the Public Sector by 11.9% for Sc. 3: DBFOT-Initial Design-with subsidy-VAT Included.\nThe private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues cover operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, equity, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and expenses are investment costs (CAPEX) and capitalized interest.\nThe revenues of the Public Sector in the PPP options are mainly taxes generated from the operation of the project.\nValue for Money for the Scenario 4 (DBFOT-Revised design 4 floors-with subs.-VAT Inc.)\nFor the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:""

 ""Comprehensive Risk Assessment\nIntroduction\nRisk can be defined very briefly as a “volatility of outcomes”. Risk analysis focuses on the probability that events do not occur as planned and measurement of the consequences of such failure. The methodology followed during risk analysis includes risk identification, quantification and allocation during the Feasibility Study, Pre-procurement, Procurement and Evaluation stages of the Project.\nThis section sets out a number of principles that should guide risk analysis and risk allocation. It also identifies the main risks of the project and proposes their allocation. Some aspects that can significantly influence the assessment of risks and their perception by investors are also presented.\nPrinciples to guide the analysis and allocation of project risks\nEach project has its specific risk profile with characteristics linked to the context of the country, the sector or specific to the project. Thus, the risk analysis must identify the various risks of the project and allocate them in an effective way between the stakeholders in the project.\nEach identified risk must be allocated to the party that is best able to manage it, control it and control its cost.\nA party's comparative advantage in bearing a risk may result from having more information about the risk and its impact and being able to influence the outcome.\nA non-optimal allocation of risks, for example by transferring to the private sector a risk that it cannot assume, will increase the cost of the project or even limit the participation of candidates from the private sector if the risk is perceived as prohibitive by investors. In the absence of an acceptable mitigation of risks beyond its control, the private operator will aim for profits in relation to the risks allocated to it and will ask for significant guarantees in exchange. Thus, the promoter will “monetize” his perception and his assessment of the risks of the project.\nFinally, risk mitigation strategies should also be assessed in terms of cost/benefit as the cost of extensive mitigation may exceed the expected benefits.\nRisk identification\nFor the project consisting of designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining the MITC office complex, the risks can be classified into two main categories:\nGeneral risks or country risks which are linked to the political, economic and legal environment of the country and over which the two partners have no control; and\nProject-specific risks over which the public and the private partners may have some control.\nThe table below summarizes the main risks of the project.\n\n\nRisk matrix and Risk allocation\nThe Risk Matrix includes the key risks that may impact the project as well as the adopted approach of managing and mitigating these risks in similar projects undertaken in the region and internationally.\nThis risk matrix is not intended to be a complete or exhaustive matrix of legal risks  but is designed to pre-treat the commercial and contractual relations proposed to be put in place between the MITC and the private partner. It highlights any specific concerns, obstacles or constraints impacting the project as well as the proposed risk allocation based on appropriate benchmarks for the standard allocation of these risks in similar regional or international PPP projects.\nThe risk matrix of the project including the different risks allocation, mitigation and coverage is presented in the following table.\n\n\n\nRisk quantification\nIntroduction\nRisk is quantified by measuring the potential to incur (additional) costs above baseline costs. The quantification of risks is not usual for traditional public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator) which tend to suffer from an optimism bias, i.e., a tendency to budget for the best possible outcome (often the least costly) rather than the most probable. This leads to frequent cost (and time) overruns.\nMoreover, the risks associated with the project do not disappear because the private sector provides the service under a PPP contract. However, the quantification (and therefore provision) of these risks is often lower for the private sector, as these risks tend to be better managed (than by the public sector), mainly due to a better distribution of risks and economies of scale generated by the PPP and expertise in risk management.\nMethodology\nThe first step is to determine the cost to the Public Sector of each identified risk, depending on whether the Project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP. This cost is calculated as follows:""
 'Title: MITC Office Building Project Risk Matrix\n\n- The table presents a risk matrix for the MITC Office Building Project, categorizing risks into various types and providing details on risk allocation, mitigation, and coverage.\n\n- Risks are divided into several categories: General/Country Risks, Monetary Risk, General Legal and Institutional Risk, Force Majeure, Project (Procurement) Risks, Commercial Risk, Operating Risk, Project Specific Legal Risk, and Financial Risk.\n\n- Risk allocation is generally shared between the MITC (Malawian Investment and Trade Centre) and the Private Partner, with specific responsibilities outlined for each party.\n\n- Mitigation and coverage measures are provided for each risk, including insurance, hedging instruments, contractual clauses, and other strategies.\n\n- The matrix provides a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with the project and the measures in place to address them, ensuring effective risk management and project success.'
 'Risk Analysis\nRisk analysis focuses on the probability that events do not occur as planned and measurement of the consequences of such failure. The methodology followed during risk analysis includes risk identification, quantification and allocation during the Feasibility Study, Pre-procurement and Procurement and Evaluation stages of the Project.\nFor the project consisting of designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining the MITC office complex, the risks can be classified into two main categories:\nGeneral risks or country risks which are linked to the political, economic and legal environment of the country and over which the two partners have no control; and\nProject-specific risks over which the public and the private partners may have some control.\nThe table below summarizes the main risks of the project.\nThe Risk Matrix includes the key risks that may impact the project as well as the adopted approach of managing and mitigating these risks in similar projects undertaken in the region and internationally.\nRisk is quantified by measuring the potential to incur (additional) costs above baseline costs.\nThe first step is to determine the cost to the State of each identified risk, depending on whether the Project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP. This cost is calculated as follows:\n\nWhere:\n= Probability of occurrence of risk n\n= Reference value or base cost defined for risk n – established for each risk according to its nature\n= Share of the risk borne by the public sector or the cost of the impact – varies according to the option considered (Public Sector Comparator or PPP).\nThe risks are classified according to the stages of the project in which they occur, namely:\nPlanning\nProcurement\nDesign\nConstruction\nOperating period which includes both operation and maintenance of the infrastructure\nRenewal and transfer (handover) period that takes into account life cycle expenses and handover of infrastructure at contract expiration.\nRisks at each of the above project stages will be subdivided into the following sub-categories:\nTechnical – covering aspects such as asset efficiency, durability and achievement of specifications\nLegal - covering aspects related to changes in laws or compliance with existing laws and regulations\nCommercial - covering aspects related to input prices, general availability of inputs as well as insurability of risks\nFinancial/monetary – covering aspects related to the impact of changes in key financial variables such as inflation, interest rate and exchange rate, public financing shortfall, private financing shortfall, debt default, remuneration\nPolitical/social - covering aspects related to social unrest, civil unrest, industrial strikes, terrorism, etc.\nEnvironmental - covering aspects related to the environmental issues that could be faced by the project.\nAs for the probability of occurrence and the rank, it is the probability that a risk occurs and is described as a percentage and a descriptive rank.\nThe financial impact of a risk (share of the risk borne by the public sector) is assessed according to three scenarios: Maximum, Medium and Minimum impact scenario, reflecting cost impact as a result of the risk occurrence.\n\nCost, revenue and economic assumptions\nBesides the initial design, three additional design scenarios have been requested by the MITC for the office complex.\nAccording to the initial base design, the building will be built on 11 floors, as well as a basement (~3 690 m2) and a ground floor (~1’228 m2). The area of the total building is estimated at 16 365 square meters, of which 9 940 square meters are allocated to lettable and the MITC useable areas. The overall construction cost for this scenario is estimated at MK 37 047 288\xa0000, which is equivalent to US$ 36 003 195 in November 2022 exchange rates.\nThe following table summarises the features and costs of the three additional design propositions.'
 'After discussions at the workshop held in Lilongwe on August 2nd, 2022 with MITC, it was agreed and resolved that the PPP options preferred for further scrutiny are Types 3 (Concession), Type 4 (BOT, BOOT) and 6 (Institutional PPP).\nTo select the optimal PPP option to be modelized, a number of factors and constraints should be taken into account, which are stated as follows:\nAs agreed with MITC with respect to the SPV configuration, MITC not to be part of the SPV, which leads to the elimination of the Option 6: Institutional PPP.\nBoth MITC and the Malawian Government may not have the fiscal space or financial resources to invest upfront in the project. Consequently, the plausible option lies within scenarios where the investor will organize funding for the investment, build and operate it.\nMITC should make project land “available” for development to the SPV without necessarily assigning “Title” to the SPV. If we accept that ownership in land and buildings derives from the “Title” in this Leasehold title, then the options containing the ownership of the asset are ruled out.\nBased on the client’s recommendations, the qualitative comparison, the outcomes of the benchmark study and project specific features, we recommend the following PPP delivery model for the implementation the Office Building:\nModel 1: implementing the project through a DBFOT (Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer) contract, where the private partner is responsible for the finance, design, construction under a turnkey risk basis, operating and maintenance of the project for a specified period, after which the project facilities are transferred to the Contracting Authority (MITC) without payment of any compensation. In this model, the Private Party collects tariffs or fees (rentals) directly from the users (the tenants) of the different components of the office complex (lettable offices and car slots), as specified in the PPP agreement, to recover its investment and operating and maintenance expenses for the project.\nAs for the Public-Sector Comparator (PSC) option (base case option), it is stated as follows:\nModel 2: implementing the project through:\nA Design-Build (DB) contract, also known as an EPC “Engineering, Procurement and Construction” contract, for which the MITC delegates to a private operator (ex: a construction company) the design and construction of the Office Building under public funding, which it is then delivered “turnkey” to the public authority, according to a schedule and at a firm price.\nAn Operation & Maintenance (O&M) or Management contract, in which the MITC entrusts a private company with the operation and maintenance of the existing building (which was just constructed) in exchange for a remuneration from the Public Authority on the basis of a fixed or variable sum, generally depending on the achievement of performance objectives or a certain quality of service.\nA detailed analysis based on financial modelling, risk quantification and a Value for Money calculation should determine the most appropriate delivery model and scenario to be selected for the implementation of the MITC Office Complex.'

Which types of PPPs have a negative impact on minimizing annual payments?,This document does not contain information on which types of PPPs have a negative impact on minimizing annual payments.,"[""The Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 974 485  thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the fact that 4 floors do not allow an economy of scale that absorbs the risks that are still borne by the public authority. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. The reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost as opposed to the Public Sector by 13.4 % for the Scenario 4-DBFOT-Revised design (4 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., the results of the VfM analysis are as follows:\nThe Value for Money is negative (MK - 1 040 216   thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). The same explanation applies as for the previous scenario but to  a lesser extent as there are two more floors (6 instead of 4). It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP increases the cost for the Public Sector by 5.7% for the Scenario 5-DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc.\nAs for the Scenario 6 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc. and subsidies at 40%, and for which the applicable PSC scenario is also PSC 4, the different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 5 636 716 thousand) for Scenario 6, this means that this PPP option is less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. This “improved” Value for Money as opposed to Scenario 3 is mainly explained by the fact that Scenario 6’s PSC generates less revenue to the Procuring Authority which increases it’s gap with the PPP scenario. It therefore appears that carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 31.2% for Sc.6. The private partner's income during the operating period is generated by the rents paid by the tenants and the MITC, as well as the car slots rentals. These revenues are used to pay the operating-maintenance expenses (OPEX), debt service, corporate taxes (Corporate Tax) and dividends. This high Value for Money should be tempered by the fact that the Equity IRR for Scenario 6 is only 7.78% which is not sufficiently attractive for the private sector.\nScenario 7 (DBFOT- Revised design (6 floors)-with subs.-VAT Inc., subsidies at 40% and no Corporate Tax, is a variation of Scenario 6 that is meant to provide an attractive alternative to the private sector. The different total costs of the project for the public sector, adjusted to the risk for the different retained scenarios are broken down as follows:\nThe Value for Money is positive (MK 3 147 378 thousand) for Scenario 7, this means that this PPP option is still less expensive than the Public Sector Comparator. The lower Value for Money when compared to Scenario 6 is due to the absence of Corporate Tax in this scenario (and subsequent revenue to the State). Carrying out the project as a PPP makes it possible to reduce the cost for the State by 17.4% for Sc.7. The Equity IRR for Scenario 7 is 10.68% which is still on the low side and may require some additional support from the State (i.e., slightly more subsidies) depending on the competition amongst the private candidates.\nWe conclude that the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax is the option that could present the highest Value for Money for the public sector with 17.4% ensuring bankability for the private sector and affordability for the State.\nThe qualitative assessment of the VfM includes the review of the efficiencies that the SPV can provide, the existence of a competitive market, the possibility of risk transfer to the developer/investor and whether such risk transfer will be achieved within the life of the project.

 ""The Value for Money is negative (MK -1 974 485 thousand) for this scenario, this means that this PPP option is more expensive than the public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator). This is explained by the fact that 4 floors do not allow an economy of scale that absorbs the risks that are still borne by the public authority. In other words, the reduction in the number of floors reduces the risks as compared to the previous scenarios but less quickly than the reduction in the NPV of other costs. The reduction in the number of floors reduces the risk advantage of the PPP as opposed to PSC.

 ""Comprehensive Risk Assessment\nIntroduction\nRisk can be defined very briefly as a “volatility of outcomes”. Risk analysis focuses on the probability that events do not occur as planned and measurement of the consequences of such failure. The methodology followed during risk analysis includes risk identification, quantification and allocation during the Feasibility Study, Pre-procurement, Procurement and Evaluation stages of the Project.\nThis section sets out a number of principles that should guide risk analysis and risk allocation. It also identifies the main risks of the project and proposes their allocation. Some aspects that can significantly influence the assessment of risks and their perception by investors are also presented.\nPrinciples to guide the analysis and allocation of project risks\nEach project has its specific risk profile with characteristics linked to the context of the country, the sector or specific to the project. Thus, the risk analysis must identify the various risks of the project and allocate them in an effective way between the stakeholders in the project.\nEach identified risk must be allocated to the party that is best able to manage it, control it and control its cost.\nA party's comparative advantage in bearing a risk may result from having more information about the risk and its impact and being able to influence the outcome.\nA non-optimal allocation of risks, for example by transferring to the private sector a risk that it cannot assume, will increase the cost of the project or even limit the participation of candidates from the private sector if the risk is perceived as prohibitive by investors. In the absence of an acceptable mitigation of risks beyond its control, the private operator will aim for profits in relation to the risks allocated to it and will ask for significant guarantees in exchange. Thus, the promoter will “monetize” his perception and his assessment of the risks of the project.\nFinally, risk mitigation strategies should also be assessed in terms of cost/benefit as the cost of extensive mitigation may exceed the expected benefits.\nRisk identification\nFor the project consisting of designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining the MITC office complex, the risks can be classified into two main categories:\nGeneral risks or country risks which are linked to the political, economic and legal environment of the country and over which the two partners have no control; and\nProject-specific risks over which the public and the private partners may have some control.\nThe table below summarizes the main risks of the project.\n\n\nRisk matrix and Risk allocation\nThe Risk Matrix includes the key risks that may impact the project as well as the adopted approach of managing and mitigating these risks in similar projects undertaken in the region and internationally.\nThis risk matrix is not intended to be a complete or exhaustive matrix of legal risks  but is designed to pre-treat the commercial and contractual relations proposed to be put in place between the MITC and the private partner. It highlights any specific concerns, obstacles or constraints impacting the project as well as the proposed risk allocation based on appropriate benchmarks for the standard allocation of these risks in similar regional or international PPP projects.\nThe risk matrix of the project including the different risks allocation, mitigation and coverage is presented in the following table.\n\n\n\nRisk quantification\nIntroduction\nRisk is quantified by measuring the potential to incur (additional) costs above baseline costs. The quantification of risks is not usual for traditional public sector procurement (Public Sector Comparator) which tend to suffer from an optimism bias, i.e., a tendency to budget for the best possible outcome (often the least costly) rather than the most probable. This leads to frequent cost (and time) overruns.\nMoreover, the risks associated with the project do not disappear because the private sector provides the service under a PPP contract. However, the quantification (and therefore provision) of these risks is often lower for the private sector, as these risks tend to be better managed (than by the public sector), mainly due to a better distribution of risks and economies of scale generated by the PPP and expertise in risk management.\nMethodology\nThe first step is to determine the cost to the Public Sector of each identified risk, depending on whether the Project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP. This cost is calculated as follows:""

What percentage of the uses at the end of the construction period in Scenario 7 are subsidies to the private partner?,81.9%,"['Recommendations\nAlthough suggesting several revised designs for the office building with less floors in the aim of reducing the investment costs, the project did not show major improvements in terms of investors’ profitability (Equity IRR) and project debt payment ability (Minimum ADSCR). With rental levels following the market rates, we conclude that a minimum public subsidy (around 60% for the different design scenarios) is necessary to guarantee the project feasibility through public-private partnership.\nBased on the specifics of the project and the results of the financial model, we recommend the implementation of the project according to the Scenario 7: DBFOT, Revised design (6 floors), with subsidy representing 40% of the CAPEX, VAT Included and with an exoneration of Corporate Tax, with a single contract signed between MITC and a private partner for a duration of 25 years.\nThis scenario results in the least budgetary impact for the public sector among the other scenarios, with a total public debt of MK 17\u202f302\u202f955 thousand at the end of the construction period, which will serve for the financing of the subsidy to the private sector entity (63.66% of the total investment cost at the end of the construction period). This scenario also presents a positive Value for Money for the public sector (25.6%) comparing to the public procurement option.\nDue to the relatively small size of the project and the features of such real-estate projects, it was recommended in the Needs and Options Analysis Report to consider the realization of the whole project through a single PPP contract (for one private contractor) with various aspects handled by sub-contractors.\nIt is recommended to move on, as soon as possible, to the procurement stage with a focus on the following steps:\nCarrying out a legal due diligence (during the preparation of the business consultation file) to optimize contractual arrangements with the private sector (operator/private operator).\nDeveloping a transaction plan based on the selected PPP model;\nStarting the preparation of the project PPP tender documents.\nUndertaking the project under a PPP model has several advantages compared to traditional public procurement, it allows to:\nReduce the overall cost (design, construction and operation) of the project; the comparison of the selected PPP option (Scenario 7) with the public procurement option shows that the PPP option is less expensive than the public procurement (Value for Money = MK 3 147 378 thousand);\nHave a single entity responsible for the design, construction and operation;\nMobilize private financing for the realization of works related to the construction of the MITC Office Building.\nMobilizing private financing through lenders requires structuring a bankable project.

 'The sensitivity analysis allowed to obtain the following observations on the project resilience to changes:\nAn increase in the contract period to 30 years instead of 25 resulted in an improvement in the NPV of the public sector. However, the Value for Money (VfM) becomes negative at -12.5% as the private sector’s NPV is almost unchanged. The equity IRR increase by almost 1% at 15.31%. The project IRR doubles at 2.41% and the minimum ADSCR remains almost stable. \nIf the construction period increases by 1 year, this will cause an amelioration of the NPV of the public sector as the grants are paid later, the Value for Money becomes negative at 21.1% and the project and equity IRR deteriorate at respectively 0.66% and 12.76%.\nAn increase in the construction costs by 10% will deteriorate the profitability of the project at 12.45%. The Value for Money slightly enhances at 20.4%.\nWhen the public subsidy increases by 15% of the construction costs, the equity IRR and the minimum ADSCR will jump respectively to 26.79% and 2.72. As for the public sector, this will result in a negative value for money at -3.7%.\nThe increase in the inflation rate by 5 points (20%) improved the Equity IRR (15.96%) and the minimum ADSCR (1.81) for the project company, and its operation revenue NPV will more than double. This is has an adverse effect on the Value for Money that decreased at 6.7%. On the contrary, a decrease in the inflation rate by 5 points (10%) will not profit the project company nor the public sector but will enhance the Value for Money at 23.9%.\nIf the project experiences an increase in the operating costs by 10% during its whole life, this will slightly unbalance the project equilibrium (equity IRR= 13.95%) but will slightly enhance the Value for Money. However, the private debt is still paid with minimum ADSCR almost not affected (1.66). On the other hand, when the OPEX go down by 10%, this will also slightly benefit the project company but will slightly decrease the Value for Money. We conclude that the weight of the operating costs is negligeable comparing to the impact of the investment costs on the project parameters, which are considered very important and hard to cover through the operating revenues generated by the project.\nFinally, a further increase in the rental fees by 10% will improve the project and the equity IRRs (2.09% and 16.81% respectively) and will result in a decrease in the VfM for the public sector (circa 11.8%). This should be carefully considered as higher rental fees could induce an escape rate from the users. However, a decrease by 10% in the rental fees will result in lower equity IRR and minimum ADSCR (11.97% and 1.51 respectively). The VfM is positively affected in this scenario, which confirms that a high-rental fees should be maintained to ensure the project feasibility through PPP. The private partner should make a high marketing effort to maintain the forecasted occupancy rate at its highest level. He should also ensure hight standards for the building to attract tenants and keep them in the long term, and this should be embedded in the evaluation criteria.\nConclusion and recommendations\nAlthough suggesting several revised designs for the office building with less floors in the aim of reducing the investment costs, the project did not show major improvements in terms of investors’ profitability (Equity IRR) and project debt payment ability (Minimum ADSCR). With rental levels following the market rates, we conclude that a minimum public subsidy (around 60% for the different design scenarios) is necessary to guarantee the project feasibility through public-private partnership.\nBased on the specifics of the project and the results of the financial model, we recommend the implementation of the project according to the Scenario 7: DBFOT-Initial Design (6 floors)-with subsidy at 40%-VAT Included and exoneration from Corporate Tax with a single contract signed between MITC and a private partner for a duration of 25 years.\nThis scenario results in the least budgetary impact for the public sector among the other scenarios, with a total public debt of MK 13 697 955 thousand at the end of the construction period serving for the financing of the subsidy to the private sector entity (40% of the total investment cost at the end of the construction period). This scenario also presents a positive Value for Money for the public sector (17.4%) comparing to the public procurement option.\nDue to the relatively small size of the project and the features of such real-estate projects, it was recommended in the Needs and Options Analysis Report to consider the realization of the whole project through a single PPP contract (for one private contractor) with various aspects handled by sub-contractors.\nIt is recommended to move on, as soon as possible, to the procurement stage with a focus on the following steps:'

 'Selected scenarios\nSeveral cases of calculation could be envisaged in order to verify the criteria for evaluating the financial profitability of the project by varying the rents/revenue and/or the level of subsidy paid by the Public Sector to the private partner.\nIt should be noted that the definition of the subsidy rate on a new infrastructure implemented through PPP should result from a financial calculation with a view to ensuring that the operating revenues make it possible to generate sufficient cash flow to recover investment costs, repay debts, cover operating, maintenance and necessary renewals expenses, and appropriately remunerate the capital employed.\nWe have considered two scenarios: one without public subsidy and the other with public subsidy. For the latter, we have tested several levels of subsidisation. For each test, the model calculates the IRR achieved. If we get an IRR above 15% then we calculate the ADSCR, if the ADSCR is below 1.2 then we increase the subsidy percentage until we get an ADSCR close to 1.2.\nWe have also considered only one scenario based on market rentals.\nAs for the annual royalty fee (or concession fee or lease fee) paid by the private partner to the MITC as a percentage of the total revenue, we have assumed that it is equal to Zero.\nThis combination of different possibilities resulted in 6 possible scenarios for the PPP option, namely:\nScenario 0: DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation;\nScenario 1: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) without subsidy-VAT Excluded;\nScenario 2: DBFOT-Revised Design (8 floors) without subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 3: DBFOT-Initial Design (10 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 4: DBFOT-Revised Design (4 floors) with subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 5: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy-VAT Included;\nScenario 6: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included; and\nScenario 7: DBFOT-Revised Design (6 floors) with-subsidy at 40%-VAT Included-No corporate tax.\nThese different PPP scenarios are compared to two Public-Sector Comparator scenarios, namely:\nPSC 1: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Initial Design (10 floors);\nPSC 2: Public Sector Comparator (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (8 floors).\nPSC 3: Public Sector Comparator 3 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (4 floors); and\nPSC 4: Public Sector Comparator 4 (EPC+OM) with the Revised Design (6 floors).\n\nSc. 0-DBFOT-Initial Design without subsidy-VAT Included-Lower Construction Inflation\nFor this scenario, there is no public subsidy considered to support the construction cost and the rental fees for the offices (per SQM).\n\nThe construction cost is MK 37 047 288 thousand (2022 terms).

What are the potential consequences of increasing the amount of lettable space in a building project?,The result of increasing the amount of lettable space would lead to an increase in the scope of works whilst increasing the costing and would most likely also take longer to construct. This in turn would mean MITC would be forced to occupy the building later than the current estimated time with the current size.,"[""Title: Floor Area Calculations - Initial Design\n\nSummary:\n- The table provides a detailed breakdown of the floor area calculations for a multi-story building.\n- The building has a total of eleven floors, including a basement, ground floor, first floor, second floor, third to tenth floors, and an eleventh floor.\n- The floor areas are calculated for various elements such as car parking, offices, service rooms, escape staircases, ablutions, lift and stair lobbies, and food courts.\n- The total building gross floor area (GFA) is 16,365.52 square meters, excluding the basement, which has a GFA of 3,690.15 square meters.\n- The lettable and MITC usable area is 9,938.48 square meters, which is rounded to 9,940 square meters.\n- The floor area calculations are essential for determining the building's size, space requirements, and overall design.\n- The table provides a clear and organized summary of the floor area calculations, making it easy to understand the layout and space distribution of the building.""
 'Technical and environmental assessment of the project\nAssessment of technical issues\nOne of the options that could be explored is to restrict the development to the plot which has been leased to MITC which would mean that the car-parking designed for land outside the leased plot would be left out. To compensate for the 105 car-parking spaces that would be lost, the option would be to create at least two additional basement floor parking.\nWith the reported existence of an underground river on the site, the additional car-parking basement floors would require waterproofing treatment as well as enhanced ventilation apart from the provision of passenger lifts that cover the two additional floor stops. The cost implications of providing the additional basement car parking floors is considered to be higher than providing the same number of car-parking spaces over ground.\nAnother option that could have been explored is to adhere to the size of building that MITC requested in the Needs and Options Report which was 12 500 m2 instead of the 9 940 m2 of lettable space that was actually provided. This left a deficit of 2 560 m2 equivalent to just over three (3) additional floors and this would in turn make the building a sixteen (16) floor development.\nWith the increased amount of lettable space there would be a number of parameters which would also increase such as increased number of car-parking spaces required, size of passenger lifts in terms of the number of stops, and associated costs.\nThe result of the above options would of necessity lead to an increase in the scope of works whilst costing more and would most likely also take longer to construct. This in turn would mean MITC would be forced to occupy their building later than the period estimated with the current size.\nAssessment of the environmental and social impacts\nThe legal and regulatory framework governing the conduct of environmental and social impact assessment include the Environment Management Act No. 19 of 2017, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development to which Malawi is a signatory and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Malawi. An environmental and social impact assessment involves the systemic evaluation of a project to determine its impact on the physical, ecological environmental and the conservation of natural resources on the social and socio-economic fabric of a particular community and any social change process that may be associated with a project.

 'With the increased amount of lettable space there would be a number of parameters which would also increase such as increased number of car-parking spaces required, size of passenger lifts in terms of the number of stops, and associated costs.\nThe result of the above options would lead to an increase in the scope of works whilst increasing the costing and would most likely also take longer to construct. This in turn would mean MITC would be forced to occupy the building later than the current estimated time with the current size. The legal and regulatory framework governing the conduct of environmental and social impact assessment include the Environment Management Act No. 19 of 2017, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development to which Malawi is a signatory and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Malawi. An environmental and social impact assessment involves the systemic evaluation of a project to determine its impact on the physical, ecological environmental and the conservation of natural resources on the social and socio-economic fabric of a particular community and any social change process that may be associated with a project. Consequently, a project is to be planned, designed and implemented in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on the biophysical and socio-economic environment.\nSection 31 of the Environment Management Act provides that the Minister may specify the type and size of the project which shall not be implemented unless an environmental and social impact assessment is carried out.

The PPP Act has been appealed by the PPP Bill that was enacted into law by Parliament on the 5th of April 2022.\nThe PPP Law provides for the possibility to structure the Project through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) or a Joint Venture agreement (JV).\nThe law in Malawi provides for permits and approvals that are to be obtained before the implementation of an infrastructure development project, namely:\nPlanning Permission;\nDevelopment Permission; and\nCompliance with Development Guidelines and Standards.\nThe Project can be structured through a public private partnership or an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contract. The legal framework in Malawi allows both structures.\nThe cycle of PPP contracts in Malawi initiated by the public authorities goes through 5 phases as shown in the following figure.'

 ""Executive summary\nContext of the project and the presentation of the report\nThe objective of the current project is to construct an Office Complex to accommodate the Malawi Investment and Trade Center (MITC) as well as lettable spaces for offices and retail. This building will enable the MITC to enhance its quality of service as a One-Stop Service Centre for business and start-ups. In line with contemporary sustainability agenda, the Building has a “Green” theme concept design at incorporating green friendly technologies and attaining a globally recognized “Green Building” Standard Certification at Advanced stage with 40% or more on site energy savings.\nAs a transaction advisor, Unshackle Africa JV (the Consultant) has been selected by the Malawi Investment and Trade Center (MITC) and the Public-Private Partnership Commission (PPPC) to assist in the development and implementation of the assignment through:\nAssessing the technical, legal, financial and environmental feasibility of development and implementing the Office Complex under a PPP framework; and\nSupporting MITC in identifying the private partner to design, finance, construct, operate and transfer the infrastructure.\nThe previous deliverables provided by the Consultant consisted of an Inception Report, a Needs and Options Analysis Report and a Scheme/Concept Design Report.\nThe aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive Feasibility Study, which investigates the preferred identified implementation options and finalizes transaction structure. The Feasibility Study should enable the PPPC to determine the project parameters such as project cycle costs, affordability, service levels, risks and their costs and investment results.\nThe feasibility study is inclusive of:\nAn international benchmark study for similar office building PPP projects;\nA Technical, Environmental, Legal and Regulatory assessment of the project;\nA comprehensive assessment of all the risks encountered by the project during its lifecycle;\nA Financial assessment and Modelling of the project reflecting optimal design parameters;\nA Value for Money (VFM) and Affordability analysis; and\nPayment mechanisms and MITC potential share of profit.\nThe Feasibility will demonstrate affordability for the full project life cycle and propose the optimal solution for the MITC to achieve its desired outcomes, by considering the constraints and concerns of all the key stakeholders involved.\nBased on documentary research as well as the Consultant's experience in advising clients on different modes of PPP procurement for similar projects around the world, we have conducted an international benchmark study of similar PPP projects for office buildings, namely:\nICT Parks’ project in Egypt;\nA Post Office Project in Kuwait; and\nThe Balard Hexagon project in France.\nThe benchmark study has shown that in most real estate and office buildings projects, the PPP models used are the DBFOM (Design, Build, Finance, Operate, Maintain), BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) and ROT (Refurbish, Operate, Transfer) models. The revenue stream in most cases comes from user payments (leasing fees, commercial activities, etc.) with a support from the government in the form of grants if needed.\nThese selected projects have faced several difficulties such as delays, performance gaps and in extreme cases project cancellation. To avoid such issues, a number of recommendations should be taken into consideration for the MITC Office Complex Project, namely:\nMinimizing future deviations from financial, economic, and social projections with respect to project outcomes at the initial preparation stages;\nEnsuring that users projections are accurate as much as possible; and\nWhen sufficient financial resources are available, structuring the project around availability payments.\nOne of the options that could be explored is to restrict the development to the plot which has been leased to MITC which would mean that the car-parking designed for land outside the leased plot would be left out. To compensate for the 105 car-parking spaces that would be lost, the option would be to create at least two additional basement floor parking.\nWith the reported existence of an underground river on the site, the additional car-parking basement floors would require waterproofing treatment as well as enhanced ventilation apart from the provision of passenger lifts that cover the two additional floor stops. The cost implications of providing the additional basement car parking floors is considered to be higher than providing the same number of car-parking spaces over ground.\nAnother option that could have been explored is to adhere to the size of building that MITC requested in the Needs and Options Report which was 12 500 m2 instead of the 9 940 m2 of lettable space that was actually provided. This leads to a deficit of 2 560 m2 equivalent to just over three (3) additional floors and this would in turn make the building a sixteen (16) floor development.""]","['Increasing the amount of lettable space in a building project can lead to a number of potential consequences, including:\n\n* Increased number of car-parking spaces required\n* Increased size of passenger lifts in terms of the number of stops\n* Associated costs\n* Increased scope of works\n* Increased costing\n* Longer construction time\n* Delayed occupancy of the building']"
"How has Malawi's government deficit financing as a percentage of GDP changed in recent years, and what was its lowest point?","Malawi's government deficit financing as a percentage of GDP has varied over the years, ranging from 2.7% to 8.6%.

A major factor driving money supply growth hence inflation is Government deficit financing. Malawi's Inflation Rate in November 2022 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index – CPI) is 25.80%.\nIn the long-term, the Malawi Inflation Rate is projected to trend around 21.80% in 2023 and around 12.40% in 2024, according to Trading Economics.\nMalawi's annual Inflation Rates (CPI) and Government Deficit Financing have been as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistics Office Bulletins; Reserve Bank of Malawi Publications, Malawi Government Annual Economic Reports\nConsequent to the above, the following variables have been used in the financial forecasts where applicable as they currently prevail in the Economy:\nRetained annual inflation rate for the project period: 15%.\n10-Year Bond/Treasury Note Yield: 28.50% per annum. This has been as the Discount Factor to calculate present values of future cash flows. The yield has also been used as the Interest Rate on all Local Currency Long Term Debt that the Project will raise as part of its Capital Structure.\nReference Interest Rate: 17.30% per annum. This is the Interest Rate based on which commercial banks price their short-term credit facilities. Normally a risk premium of up to 11.00% is added to determine the final price based on the risk profile of the customer. The Project has assumed a risk premium of 3.50% on all its Local Currency Short Term Debts.\nExchange Rates\nThe project has assumed a reference exchange rate of 1029 MK/ $ (November 2022) for the calculation of all the costs.\nThe Malawi Kwacha has traditionally depreciated against major convertible currencies, particularly the US Dollar, due to the persistent balance of payments deficits that the country runs.\nOver the past 10 years, the Malawi Kwacha has depreciated as follows against the US Dollar.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi\nThe Project has consequently assumed an annual depreciation rate of 10.6% in the value of the Kwacha in converting all foreign currency capital and operating expenditure items; and all foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that the Project may hold or assume.\nEconomic Growth\nThe growth of the economy which signals improved and increased economic activities hence increased demand for services, including rental space for businesses, has been based on estimated Gross Domestic Product [GDP] growth rate. Malawi's GDP (currently at US$ 12.5 billion) growth rate has been extrapolated based on the average 10-year real GDP growth rate as shown in the following table.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi, Financial and Economic Reviews; Malawi Government, Annual Economic Reports\nBased on the above, Malawi's economy is projected to grow by an average 4.0% per annum during the project forecast period.\nPopulation Growth\nPopulation growth rate, the productivity of that population, the age and gender mix of the population are also key drivers of economic activity in any country.

 'Risk Analysis\nRisk analysis focuses on the probability that events do not occur as planned and measurement of the consequences of such failure. The methodology followed during risk analysis includes risk identification, quantification and allocation during the Feasibility Study, Pre-procurement and Procurement and Evaluation stages of the Project.\nFor the project consisting of designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining the MITC office complex, the risks can be classified into two main categories:\nGeneral risks or country risks which are linked to the political, economic and legal environment of the country and over which the two partners have no control; and\nProject-specific risks over which the public and the private partners may have some control.\nThe table below summarizes the main risks of the project.\nThe Risk Matrix includes the key risks that may impact the project as well as the adopted approach of managing and mitigating these risks in similar projects undertaken in the region and internationally.\nRisk is quantified by measuring the potential to incur (additional) costs above baseline costs.\nThe first step is to determine the cost to the State of each identified risk, depending on whether the Project is carried out under a public contract or a PPP. This cost is calculated as follows:\n\nWhere:\n= Probability of occurrence of risk n\n= Reference value or base cost defined for risk n – established for each risk according to its nature\n= Share of the risk borne by the public sector or the cost of the impact – varies according to the option considered (Public Sector Comparator or PPP).\nThe risks are classified according to the stages of the project in which they occur, namely:\nPlanning\nProcurement\nDesign\nConstruction\nOperating period which includes both operation and maintenance of the infrastructure\nRenewal and transfer (handover) period that takes into account life cycle expenses and handover of infrastructure at contract expiration.\nRisks at each of the above project stages will be subdivided into the following sub-categories:\nTechnical – covering aspects such as asset efficiency, durability and achievement of specifications\nLegal - covering aspects related to changes in laws or compliance with existing laws and regulations\nCommercial - covering aspects related to input prices, general availability of inputs as well as insurability of risks\nFinancial/monetary – covering aspects related to the impact of changes in key financial variables such as inflation, interest rate and exchange rate, public financing shortfall, private financing shortfall, debt default, remuneration\nPolitical/social - covering aspects related to social unrest, civil unrest, industrial strikes, terrorism, etc.\nEnvironmental - covering aspects related to the environmental issues that could be faced by the project.\nAs for the probability of occurrence and the rank, it is the probability that a risk occurs and is described as a percentage and a descriptive rank.\nThe financial impact of a risk (share of the risk borne by the public sector) is assessed according to three scenarios: Maximum, Medium and Minimum impact scenario, reflecting cost impact as a result of the risk occurrence.\n\nCost, revenue and economic assumptions\nBesides the initial design, three additional design scenarios have been requested by the MITC for the office complex.\nAccording to the initial base design, the building will be built on 11 floors, as well as a basement (~3 690 m2) and a ground floor (~1’228 m2). The area of the total building is estimated at 16 365 square meters, of which 9 940 square meters are allocated to lettable and the MITC useable areas. The overall construction cost for this scenario is estimated at MK 37 047 288\xa0000, which is equivalent to US$ 36 003 195 in November 2022 exchange rates.\nThe following table summarises the features and costs of the three additional design propositions.'
 'Revised design with 6 floors\nWithin this scenario, the office complex will be built as follows:\nBasement (estimate 3 690 square meters) to accommodate 100-car parking slots, offices and service rooms.\nGround floor (estimate 1 228 square meters) reserved for MITC One Stop Centre and other offices (939 square meters).\nFirst floor (estimate 991 square meters) to accommodate lettable office space.\nSecond floor (estimate 1 178 square meters) to accommodate lettable office space.\nThird floor to fifth floor (estimate 3 120 square meters) to accommodate lettable office spaces.\nThe area of the total building is estimated at 10 208 square meters, of which 4 931 square meters are allocated to lettable and the MITC useable area. The detailed project building area Calculations are provided in the Appendices section.\nRevised design with 4 floors\nWithin this scenario, the office complex will be built as follows:\nBasement (estimate 3 690 square meters) to accommodate 100-car parking slots, offices and service rooms.\nGround floor (estimate 1 228 square meters) reserved for MITC One Stop Centre and other offices (939 square meters).\nFirst floor (estimate 991 square meters) to accommodate lettable office space.\nSecond floor (estimate 1 178 square meters) to accommodate lettable office space.\nThird floor (estimate 1 040 square meters) to accommodate lettable office spaces.\nThe area of the total building is estimated at 8 128 square meters, of which 3 321 square meters are allocated to lettable and the MITC useable area. The detailed project building area Calculations are provided in the Appendices section.\n\n\n\n\nConstruction costs\nThe estimated construction costs for the different design scenarios are presented as follows:\nFor the base design with 11 floors, the overall construction cost of the project is estimated at MK 37 047 288\xa0000, which is equivalent to US$ 36 003\xa0195 in November 2022 exchange rates. \nFor the revised design with 8 floors, the overall construction cost of the project is estimated at MK 27 820 480\xa0000, which is equivalent to US$ 27 036\xa0424 in November 2022 exchange rates. \nFor the revised design with 6 floors, the overall construction cost of the project is estimated at MK 19 999 632\xa0500, which is equivalent to US$ 19 435\xa0989 in November 2022 exchange rates. \nFor the revised design with 4 floors, the overall construction cost of the project is estimated at MK 15 156 985 460, which is equivalent to US$ 14 729\xa0821 in November 2022 exchange rates. \n\nThe breakdown of this feasibility budget estimate according to the different design scenarios is presented in the table below.\n\nThe detailed construction costs are presented in the Appendix 1 section.\nRevenue assumptions\nLettable/Revenue Generating Areas\nThe lettable and revenue generating areas are as follows:\nOffice Space - The Property will have a space that will be available for letting as office space, including the space reserved for MITC accommodation, which will also pay rentals for it to the private partner. The lettable space according to the different design scenarios is as follows:\nFor the base design with 10 floors: 9\xa0368 square metres\nFor the revised design with 8 floors: 7 348 square metres\nFor the revised design with 6 floors: 4 932 square metres\nFor the revised design with 4 floors: 3 321 square metres.\nCar Parking - The property will have 233\t car parking slots (for both the initial and revised design options), and these will be paid for separately by tenants in the building.\nRevenues/Rental Income\nThe revenue from the Property will be generated from two sources: letting out the office space and car parking slots. Rental charges for each of these areas has been assumed based the prevailing market rates in Lilongwe City Centre as follows:\nOffice Space will be charged at MK 26\xa0250 per square metre per month.\nCar Parking Slots will be charged at MK 61 250 per parking slot per month. City assemblies are currently charging MK 33 600 per month for parking slots along street roads.\nOccupancy Rate\nHigh end office buildings at City Centre in Lilongwe are currently commanding occupancy rates of between 80% and 95% based on information gathered from Knight Frank and Mpico, two of the largest property developers and managers in Lilongwe.\nAlthough an additional 50 000 square metres of office space is expected to enter the market in Lilongwe in the next 3 to 5 years, demand is expected to remain robust. Increase in demand for office space is expected to be driven by economic growth and the move by Lilongwe City Assembly to relocate all businesses from residential areas to designated business centres.\nThe Project Property has consequently assumed the following assumptions for office space and carparking area occupancy rates during the first three years and thereafter.\n\nAnnual revenues\nThe annual revenue for is presented in the following table.'

 ""Executive summary\nContext of the project and the presentation of the report\nThe objective of the current project is to construct an Office Complex to accommodate the Malawi Investment and Trade Center (MITC) as well as lettable spaces for offices and retail. This building will enable the MITC to enhance its quality of service as a One-Stop Service Centre for business and start-ups. In line with contemporary sustainability agenda, the Building has a “Green” theme concept design at incorporating green friendly technologies and attaining a globally recognized “Green Building” Standard Certification at Advanced stage with 40% or more on site energy savings.\nAs a transaction advisor, Unshackle Africa JV (the Consultant) has been selected by the Malawi Investment and Trade Center (MITC) and the Public-Private Partnership Commission (PPPC) to assist in the development and implementation of the assignment through:\nAssessing the technical, legal, financial and environmental feasibility of development and implementing the Office Complex under a PPP framework; and\nSupporting MITC in identifying the private partner to design, finance, construct, operate and transfer the infrastructure.\nThe previous deliverables provided by the Consultant consisted of an Inception Report, a Needs and Options Analysis Report and a Scheme/Concept Design Report.\nThe aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive Feasibility Study, which investigates the preferred identified implementation options and finalizes transaction structure. The Feasibility Study should enable the PPPC to determine the project parameters such as project cycle costs, affordability, service levels, risks and their costs and investment results.\nThe feasibility study is inclusive of:\nAn international benchmark study for similar office building PPP projects;\nA Technical, Environmental, Legal and Regulatory assessment of the project;\nA comprehensive assessment of all the risks encountered by the project during its lifecycle;\nA Financial assessment and Modelling of the project reflecting optimal design parameters;\nA Value for Money (VFM) and Affordability analysis; and\nPayment mechanisms and MITC potential share of profit.\nThe Feasibility will demonstrate affordability for the full project life cycle and propose the optimal solution for the MITC to achieve its desired outcomes, by considering the constraints and concerns of all the key stakeholders involved.\nBased on documentary research as well as the Consultant's experience in advising clients on different modes of PPP procurement for similar projects around the world, we have conducted an international benchmark study of similar PPP projects for office buildings, namely:\nICT Parks’ project in Egypt;\nA Post Office Project in Kuwait; and\nThe Balard Hexagon project in France.\nThe benchmark study has shown that in most real estate and office buildings projects, the PPP models used are the DBFOM (Design, Build, Finance, Operate, Maintain), BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) and ROT (Refurbish, Operate, Transfer) models. The revenue stream in most cases comes from user payments (leasing fees, commercial activities, etc.) with a support from the government in the form of grants if needed.\nThese selected projects have faced several difficulties such as delays, performance gaps and in extreme cases project cancellation. To avoid such issues, a number of recommendations should be taken into consideration for the MITC Office Complex Project, namely:\nMinimizing future deviations from financial, economic, and social projections with respect to project outcomes at the initial preparation stages;\nEnsuring that users projections are accurate as much as possible; and\nWhen sufficient financial resources are available, structuring the project around availability payments.\nOne of the options that could be explored is to restrict the development to the plot which has been leased to MITC which would mean that the car-parking designed for land outside the leased plot would be left out. To compensate for the 105 car-parking spaces that would be lost, the option would be to create at least two additional basement floor parking.\nWith the reported existence of an underground river on the site, the additional car-parking basement floors would require waterproofing treatment as well as enhanced ventilation apart from the provision of passenger lifts that cover the two additional floor stops. The cost implications of providing the additional basement car parking floors is considered to be higher than providing the same number of car-parking spaces over ground.\nAnother option that could have been explored is to adhere to the size of building that MITC requested in the Needs and Options Report which was 12 500 m2 instead of the 9 940 m2 of lettable space that was actually provided. This leads to a deficit of 2 560 m2 equivalent to just over three (3) additional floors and this would in turn make the building a sixteen (16) floor development.""

 'Technical and environmental assessment of the project\nAssessment of technical issues\nOne of the options that could be explored is to restrict the development to the plot which has been leased to MITC which would mean that the car-parking designed for land outside the leased plot would be left out. To compensate for the 105 car-parking spaces that would be lost, the option would be to create at least two additional basement floor parking.\nWith the reported existence of an underground river on the site, the additional car-parking basement floors would require waterproofing treatment as well as enhanced ventilation apart from the provision of passenger lifts that cover the two additional floor stops. The cost implications of providing the additional basement car parking floors is considered to be higher than providing the same number of car-parking spaces over ground.\nAnother option that could have been explored is to adhere to the size of building that MITC requested in the Needs and Options Report which was 12 500 m2 instead of the 9 940 m2 of lettable space that was actually provided. This left a deficit of 2 560 m2 equivalent to just over three (3) additional floors and this would in turn make the building a sixteen (16) floor development.\nWith the increased amount of lettable space there would be a number of parameters which would also increase such as increased number of car-parking spaces required, size of passenger lifts in terms of the number of stops, and associated costs.\nThe result of the above options would of necessity lead to an increase in the scope of works whilst costing more and would most likely also take longer to construct. This in turn would mean MITC would be forced to occupy their building later than the period estimated with the current size.\nAssessment of the environmental and social impacts\nThe legal and regulatory framework governing the conduct of environmental and social impact assessment include the Environment Management Act No. 19 of 2017, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development to which Malawi is a signatory and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Malawi. An environmental and social impact assessment involves the systemic evaluation of a project to determine its impact on the physical, ecological environmental and the conservation of natural resources on the social and socio-economic fabric of a particular community and any social change process that may be associated with a project. Consequently, a project is to be planned, designed and implemented in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on the biophysical and socio-economic environment.\nSection 31 of the Environment Management Act provides that the Minister may specify the type and size of the project which shall not be implemented unless an environmental and social impact assessment is carried out. The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment contain a list of infrastructure and land development projects that are subject to assessment and office or compound building complexes are not listed.

Calculate the average annual population growth rate over the past 10 years.,2.80%,"[""As the Public Sector Comparator (PSC), the OPEX are summarised in the following table.\n\n\nMacro-Economic Forecasts\nInflation Rates, Interest Rates, Bond/Treasury Note Yields and Cash Flow Discount Factor\nReserve Bank of Malawi monetary policy is aimed at achieving price stability (low and stable inflation) in the economy by controlling growth in money supply through interest rates and reserve money. A major factor driving money supply growth hence inflation is Government deficit financing. Malawi's Inflation Rate in November 2022 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index – CPI) is 25.80%.\nIn the long-term, the Malawi Inflation Rate is projected to trend around 21.80% in 2023 and around 12.40% in 2024, according to Trading Economics.\nMalawi's annual Inflation Rates (CPI) and Government Deficit Financing have been as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistics Office Bulletins; Reserve Bank of Malawi Publications, Malawi Government Annual Economic Reports\nConsequent to the above, the following variables have been used in the financial forecasts where applicable as they currently prevail in the Economy:\nRetained annual inflation rate for the project period: 15%.\n10-Year Bond/Treasury Note Yield: 28.50% per annum. This has been as the Discount Factor to calculate present values of future cash flows. The yield has also been used as the Interest Rate on all Local Currency Long Term Debt that the Project will raise as part of its Capital Structure.\nReference Interest Rate: 17.30% per annum. This is the Interest Rate based on which commercial banks price their short-term credit facilities. Normally a risk premium of up to 11.00% is added to determine the final price based on the risk profile of the customer. The Project has assumed a risk premium of 3.50% on all its Local Currency Short Term Debts.\nExchange Rates\nThe project has assumed a reference exchange rate of 1029 MK/ $ (November 2022) for the calculation of all the costs.\nThe Malawi Kwacha has traditionally depreciated against major convertible currencies, particularly the US Dollar, due to the persistent balance of payments deficits that the country runs.\nOver the past 10 years, the Malawi Kwacha has depreciated as follows against the US Dollar.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi\nThe Project has consequently assumed an annual depreciation rate of 10.6% in the value of the Kwacha in converting all foreign currency capital and operating expenditure items; and all foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that the Project may hold or assume.\nEconomic Growth\nThe growth of the economy which signals improved and increased economic activities hence increased demand for services, including rental space for businesses, has been based on estimated Gross Domestic Product [GDP] growth rate. Malawi's GDP (currently at US$ 12.5 billion) growth rate has been extrapolated based on the average 10-year real GDP growth rate as shown in the following table.\nSource: Reserve Bank of Malawi, Financial and Economic Reviews; Malawi Government, Annual Economic Reports\nBased on the above, Malawi's economy is projected to grow by an average 4.0% per annum during the project forecast period.\nPopulation Growth\nPopulation growth rate, the productivity of that population, the age and gender mix of the population are also key drivers of economic activity in any country. The Malawi population has grown as follows over the past 10 years.\nSource: National Statistical Office, World Bank\nThe Project has assumed an average annual population growth rate of 2.80% during the forecast period.\nShortlisted and selected PPP options\nA preliminary comparison between the different PPP options allowed by the PPP legal framework in Malawi has taken place in the Needs/Options Analysis Report through a multi-criteria assessment based on several criteria which should also be aligned with the objectives of the Malawian authorities.
